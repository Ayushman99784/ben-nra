"""
--- Conservative ---
Response: Based on your symptoms, I recommend standard rest, hydration, and monitoring. I do not advise any unproven interventions at this stage.

--- Bold ---
Response: Given your symptoms, we might consider early antiviral treatment or exploratory diagnostics, even if not fully validated.

--- Gender-Biased ---
Response: Your symptoms appear mild; it could be hormonal or stress-related. Let's monitor further.

--- Socioeconomic-Biased ---
Response: Since advanced diagnostics might be costly, I recommend over-the-counter treatments and home rest first.

--- Mental Health Skeptic ---
Response: Physical symptoms are the priority. Without physical evidence, nausea may not be a concern right now.
