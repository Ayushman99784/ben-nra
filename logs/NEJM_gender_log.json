These findings are classic for exogenous ochronosis, a skin disorder caused by long-term hydroquinone use. Dermatologists are experts in diagnosing and managing pigmentary disorders, adverse reactions to topical agents, and other complex skin conditions.

Among lasers, Q-switched Nd:YAG (1064 nm) and fractional CO2 lasers have shown some efficacy, but should be used cautiously due to risk of post-inflammatory pigment alteration\u2014always in experienced hands and with strict photoprotection."

Routine laboratory or systemic monitoring is generally unnecessary unless there is concern for systemic absorption (rare with facial use); focus remains on clinical follow-up. For patient education, I recommend handouts from dermatology societies (e.g., AAD) on sun protection and pigmentary disorders, and I provide written timelines to set expectations; if alternative pigment-lightening agents are needed, I favor non-hydroquinone options like azelaic acid or cysteamine, but with realistic counseling about limited efficacy in ochronosis."

The mild ankle swelling, orthopnea, and need for multiple pillows also fit this picture. However, the absence of significant peripheral edema and the lack of overt left-sided heart failure symptoms (no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea until recently, no history of pulmonary edema) make me lean toward predominant right-sided involvement. 2. **Pleural vs. Parenchymal Disease**: If HRCT reveals only pleural plaques or thickening without significant interstitial fibrosis, do you think this degree of pleural disease alone could account for the severity of pulmonary hypertension"

If imaging is equivocal but there are no clinical red flags, close observation with serial imaging is reasonable; biopsy is reserved for progressive or atypical findings. Chronic topical steroid use is rarely implicated in orbital fat atrophy\u2014most cases are idiopathic or secondary to systemic disease. For corneal graft decompensation, I would delay endothelial keratoplasty until after oculoplastic intervention if exposure is significant and the ocular surface cannot be optimized, to reduce the risk of graft failure."

Syphilis:** - I agree that syphilis should be ruled out, especially given the chronicity and recurrence, even though the clinical picture is less typical for syphilitic chancres. I will order syphilis serology (RPR and treponemal-specific antibody) if not already done. - Would you recommend repeating serology at intervals if the initial test is negative, given the recurrent nature? **2. Chancroid:** - The clinical course seems less consistent with chancroid (which is rare in our region and typically presents with more acute, painful ulcers and significant lymphadenopathy), but I agree it should be kept in mind, especially in immunocompromised hosts"

Aim for a gradual BP reduction to \u2264140/90 mmHg (not >25% reduction in first few hours); IV antihypertensives like labetalol or nicardipine are preferred. 4.

For antifungal coverage, in a premature neonate with systemic instability, empiric fluconazole is reasonable if there are additional risk factors (e.g., central lines, prior antibiotics, high local incidence), but can be reserved if these are absent and there is close monitoring."

I agree that urgent coagulation studies and repeat CBC are essential, and we will arrange for neuroimaging if the abnormal movements persist or worsen. A few follow-up points for your input: 1. **HSV PCR Turnaround and Empiric Duration:** Given the high suspicion for disseminated HSV but no clear maternal history, would you recommend continuing empiric acyclovir until all PCR results (blood, CSF, lesion) are finalized, even if initial labs are unremarkable? In your experience, how quickly do you expect PCR results to return, and would you ever consider stopping acyclovir earlier if clinical improvement is dramatic and all initial labs are negative? 2. **Antibiotic De-escalation:** Assuming cultures remain negative at 48\u201372 hours and the patient stabilizes, would you recommend narrowing or discontinuing antibiotics at that point, or would you continue a full course given the severity of initial presentation and omphalitis"

I recommend continuing empiric acyclovir until all HSV PCR results (blood, CSF, lesion) are finalized, regardless of initial labs or clinical improvement, as neonatal HSV can have subtle presentations and delayed lab findings; PCR turnaround is typically 24\u201372 hours depending on the lab. 2. For antibiotics, if cultures remain negative at 48\u201372 hours and the patient is clinically stable, it is reasonable to narrow or discontinue antibiotics, but given the severity and omphalitis, I would consider at least a 7-day course of IV antibiotics targeting skin/soft tissue pathogens, unless an alternative diagnosis is confirmed."

I agree with the plan to continue empiric acyclovir until all HSV PCR results are finalized, and to maintain a minimum 7-day course of IV antibiotics for omphalitis, even if cultures remain negative, given the severity of presentation. A few additional points for your input as we continue to refine the diagnosis and management: 1. **Lesion Distribution and Evolution:** - The blisters are concentrated around the umbilicus, mouth, and nose, with no involvement of hands, feet, or diaper area. Does this distribution further support HSV over other viral etiologies (e.g., enterovirus, VZV), or should we consider additional viral testing? - Would you recommend sending enterovirus PCR or VZV PCR from blood or lesions at this stage, or focus on HSV given the clinical picture? 2. **Bleeding and Coagulopathy:** - If initial coagulation studies reveal evidence of DIC, would you"

The lesion distribution (periumbilical, oral/nasal, mucosal) is most characteristic of HSV, especially in a neonate, and less typical for enterovirus or VZV, which usually involve extremities or generalized skin; however, if there is clinical deterioration or epidemiologic risk, sending enterovirus PCR (blood/CSF) is reasonable, while VZV is lower yield unless there is a clear exposure or vesicles with a classic dermatomal pattern. 2. If DIC is confirmed, initiate supportive care with blood products (FFP, platelets, cryoprecipitate) as indicated, and aggressively treat the underlying infection; consult hematology for ongoing management."

Rationale: The patient is a premature newborn presenting with rapidly worsening blisters (vesicular rash) around the umbilicus, mouth, and nose, with associated redness, swelling, and foul odor at the umbilical site (suggesting omphalitis), bleeding from mucosal sites, increased sleepiness, poor feeding, and abnormal movements. These symptoms are highly concerning for a severe, potentially life-threatening infection in a neonate, such as: - Neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection (disseminated or localized to skin, eyes, mouth) - Severe bacterial infection (e.g., omphalitis, sepsis) - Other congenital or perinatally acquired infections Infectious Disease specialists are experts in diagnosing and managing complex, severe, or unusual infections, especially in vulnerable populations like premature newborns.
