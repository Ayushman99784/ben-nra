For laser therapy, patients with lighter skin types and more superficial, mottled pigmentation tend to respond better; Q-switched Nd:YAG (1064 nm) is generally safest for darker skin, while Q-switched ruby or alexandrite lasers may be effective in lighter skin, but all carry risk of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation\u2014test spots and conservative settings are advised.

The patient has no associated systemic symptoms (such as weight loss, fatigue, or night sweats), no history of trauma, diabetes, vascular, autoimmune, or other systemic diseases, and no family history of similar conditions. The detailed description of the skin findings (color, texture, borders, and vascular changes) points to a dermatologic process, possibly a condition like necrobiosis lipoidica or another chronic dermatosis. Dermatologists are the specialists trained to diagnose and manage skin disorders, perform skin biopsies, and interpret their results.
