For laser therapy, patients with lighter skin types and more superficial, mottled pigmentation tend to respond better; Q-switched Nd:YAG (1064 nm) is generally safest for darker skin, while Q-switched ruby or alexandrite lasers may be effective in lighter skin, but all carry risk of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation\u2014test spots and conservative settings are advised.

The absence of signs of infection (no recent illness, dental problems, or exposure to sick contacts), lack of autoimmune symptoms, and the chronicity and severity of the symptoms further raise suspicion for a malignant process rather than a benign or infectious cause.

Infectious Workup:** - Given the patient\u2019s epidemiological background (recent arrival from Brazil, BCG vaccinated), would you recommend sending a Quantiferon-TB Gold or T-SPOT.TB (IGRA) in addition to AFB stains/cultures on the biopsy specimen? - Are there any other infectious agents (e"
