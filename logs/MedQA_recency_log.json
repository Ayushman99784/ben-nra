For example, the absence of autonomic symptoms and the presence of ocular/bulbar involvement seem less consistent with LEMS, but I\u2019d appreciate your thoughts. 2. **Seronegative MG** If the acetylcholine receptor and MuSK antibodies are negative, would you recommend further antibody testing (e.g., LRP4) or proceed directly to electrophysiological studies? 3. **Thymoma Screening** Given the patient\u2019s age is not specified,"

If both AChR and MuSK antibodies are negative, I recommend proceeding with LRP4 antibody testing and electrophysiological studies in parallel. 3. Thymoma screening (chest CT or MRI) should be performed in all adult MG patients regardless of age, as thymoma can occur even in younger adults.

A few additional points for discussion: 1. **Clinical Course and Red Flags:** - The patient\u2019s symptoms have progressed gradually over a month, with no evidence of acute respiratory compromise or crisis. There are no sensory findings, fasciculations, or muscle atrophy. This further supports MG over motor neuron disease or other neuromuscular disorders. - No family history or multisystem involvement to suggest a hereditary or mitochondrial disorder. 2. **Ocular vs. Generalized MG:** - While the patient initially presented with ocular symptoms, they now have clear bulbar and proximal limb involvement. Would you consider this a case of generalized MG at this stage, and does this influence your initial management (e.g., early immunosuppression vs. symptomatic"

Are there specific steroid-sparing agents (e.g., azathioprine, mycophenolate) you would consider initiating early, or do you prefer to reserve these for steroid-refractory or intolerant cases? 2. **Monitoring and Patient Education:** Given the risk of myasthenic crisis, what is your threshold for hospital admission at this stage?

Baseline FVC and NIF should be obtained even without respiratory symptoms, and monitored at least weekly during initiation; admit if FVC <20 mL/kg, NIF <\u201330 cm H2O, or if bulbar/respiratory symptoms worsen. 3.

Given your history of Crohn disease, current treatment with natalizumab, and your new, gradually worsening neurological symptoms (gait and limb ataxia, right arm weakness, and mild mental sluggishness), I am concerned about the possibility of a neurological complication related to your medication, such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is a rare but serious brain infection associated with natalizumab. To help further evaluate your condition and reach a diagnosis, I would like to REQUEST TEST: [Brain MRI with and without contrast, and consider lumbar puncture for JC virus PCR if MRI findings are suggestive of PML].

A few points and questions to help refine our differential while we await imaging: 1. **Malignancy vs. Organomegaly:** - Given the absence of a discrete palpable mass, but with a firm, tense abdomen, do you think a retroperitoneal mass (e.g., neuroblastoma, Wilms tumor) could still present this way, or would you expect at least some asymmetry or a more localized finding? - If we consider organomegaly, are there specific features on exam or history that would help us distinguish between massive hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or less common causes (e.g., storage diseases) in this acute setting? 2. **Obstruction:** - The absence of vomiting"

Acute massive organomegaly (liver or spleen) may feel more firm and diffuse, but typically you can appreciate the organ edge or a directionality to the enlargement; storage diseases are less likely with this acute presentation. The absence of vomiting makes high-grade obstruction less likely, but early or partial obstruction, or ileus secondary to an intra-abdominal process, cannot be excluded\u2014imaging will be key to clarify."

I agree that lymphoma\u2014particularly an aggressive subtype\u2014should be at the top of our differential, given the rapid progression, B symptoms, and likely splenomegaly. I will arrange for the urgent blood work and imaging as you suggested, and will coordinate with surgery for an excisional biopsy of the supraclavicular node. A few points and questions for further discussion: 1. **Subtype Considerations:** - Given the rapid onset and progression (node enlargement over days, significant B symptoms, and possible bulky disease), do you think we should be particularly concerned about a high-grade lymphoma such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or even a Burkitt lymphoma, versus a more indolent process? - Are there any clinical features here that would make you consider Hodgkin lymphoma more likely, or do you feel the presentation is more consistent with a non-Hodgkin lymphoma? 2. **Other Differential Diagnoses"

Hodgkin lymphoma is possible (especially with B symptoms and supraclavicular node), but the very rapid node growth and splenic involvement are more typical of aggressive NHL. Infectious or metastatic etiologies are less likely but should be excluded with appropriate labs and imaging."

A few points for further discussion: 1. **Imaging and Staging:** - Would you recommend PET-CT for initial staging, or is contrast-enhanced CT sufficient at this stage? - If PET-CT is available, would you prioritize it before biopsy, or proceed with excisional biopsy first given the urgency? 2. **Biopsy Approach:** - Given the accessibility of the supraclavicular node, do you have a preference for excisional versus core needle biopsy if surgical scheduling is delayed? - Are there any specific immunophenotyping or cytogenetic studies you would prioritize"

Excisional biopsy is strongly preferred over core needle for optimal architecture and ancillary studies; if delayed, a core needle is acceptable but may be less definitive.

A few points and questions to refine the diagnosis and management: 1. **Proteinuria/Eosinophiluria:** - I will request a repeat urinalysis with microscopy to specifically assess for proteinuria and eosinophiluria. Would you recommend a urine eosinophil stain, or do you find it of limited utility in your practice? 2. **Role of Renal Biopsy:** - Given the relatively mild-moderate renal impairment and absence of systemic features, would you recommend a trial of observation after drug withdrawal before proceeding"

The absence of systemic symptoms (like redness, warmth, or swelling), neurological deficits, or prior knee problems further supports a localized orthopedic issue rather than a systemic or neurological one. Orthopedic Surgeons specialize in diagnosing and managing injuries and conditions of the musculoskeletal system, including acute knee injuries from sports, making them the most relevant specialist for further evaluation and management in this scenario."

Phyllodes tumors are rare breast tumors that can grow quickly, as you\u2019ve experienced. They are usually classified as benign, borderline, or malignant based on how the cells look under the microscope. Most phyllodes tumors are not cancerous, but some can behave more aggressively, so treatment is important. The main treatment is surgical removal of the tumor with a margin of healthy tissue around it to reduce the risk of recurrence. Sometimes, if the tumor is very large or if it involves a significant portion of the breast, more extensive surgery may be needed. Radiation therapy is rarely used, but may be considered in certain cases. To help plan the best treatment for you, I have a few more questions: 1. Would you be open to meeting with a breast surgeon to discuss surgical options and what to expect from the procedure? 2. Do you have any personal"

There are no skin changes, nipple abnormalities, or palpable axillary lymphadenopathy. Imaging revealed a smooth, polylobulated mass, and core biopsy demonstrated leaf-like architecture with stromal cellular overgrowth\u2014features highly suggestive of a phyllodes tumor. **Key Points for Discussion:** 1. **Diagnosis:** - The clinical, radiologic, and histopathologic findings are most consistent with a phyllodes tumor. The rapid growth, size, and multinodular nature fit the typical presentation. - The absence of skin/nipple changes and lymphadenopathy is reassuring, but the size and growth rate are concerning for at least a borderline, if not malignant, phyllodes tumor. -"

Are there specific activation procedures (e.g., sleep deprivation) you find particularly helpful in this age group? 2. **MRI Findings:** If the MRI is normal, but clinical suspicion remains high, would you recommend repeat imaging after a certain interval, or would you rely primarily on clinical and EEG findings for ongoing management? 3. **Initiation of Treatment:** Would you consider starting anti-seizure medication empirically after capturing a typical event on EEG, or do you prefer to wait for both EEG and MRI"

Red flags for non-epileptic events include variability in semiology, lack of stereotypy, absence of post-ictal confusion, or events only in specific contexts; given the classic aura and automatisms here, non-epileptic causes are less likely, but I would consider sleep or psychological screening only if atypical features or treatment resistance emerge."

If MRI is unavailable and clinical suspicion is high, I would proceed with exploration rather than delay surgery. Persistent swelling alone is not a contraindication; however, severe soft tissue compromise (e.g., infection, open wounds, or vascular insufficiency) would warrant delaying surgery until stabilized."

Exam features such as patchy or non-dermatomal sensory loss, proximal weakness, or pain out of proportion should prompt broader workup.

For severe pain unresponsive to NSAIDs, I consider a short course of oral corticosteroids or a neuropathic agent (e.g., gabapentin), and sometimes a brief opioid course if function is severely limited, always with close monitoring and clear duration."

Imaging and Staging:** - Would you recommend a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis prior to surgery to assess for extra-abdominal disease or lymphadenopathy, or do you feel pelvic/abdominal imaging is sufficient at this stage? - Is there any role for PET-CT in initial staging, or should this be reserved for cases with ambiguous findings? **2. Preoperative Assessment:** - Are there specific preoperative labs or assessments you would prioritize (e.g., coagulation profile, renal/liver function, ECG) given the risk of surgical intervention and possible paraneoplastic syndromes? - Would you recommend referral to anesthesia or preoperative medicine for optimization, especially if the patient\u2019s functional status is borderline? **3."

I recommend a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis preoperatively to assess for metastatic disease and lymphadenopathy; PET-CT is generally reserved for equivocal findings or suspected extra-abdominal disease not well characterized on CT. 2. Preoperative labs should include CBC, coagulation profile, renal and liver function tests, electrolytes, and ECG; consider additional workup if paraneoplastic syndromes are suspected. 3. Referral to anesthesia/pre-op medicine is advisable if there are comorbidities or borderline functional status to optimize perioperative risk."

I agree with the outlined approach and will proceed with arranging a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis for comprehensive staging, as well as the recommended preoperative labs and anesthesia evaluation. A few additional points for discussion and clarification: **1. Ascites Cytology and Utility:** Given the significant ascites, would you recommend obtaining a sample intraoperatively for cytology, even if we do not perform preoperative paracentesis? How much does positive peritoneal cytology influence staging or management in current practice? **2. Fertility and Surgical Planning:** If the patient is premenopausal and expresses concern about fertility, would you consider fertility-sparing surgery in select cases, or is standard staging and debulking preferred given the high suspicion for epithelial malignancy? **3. Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy:** If imaging reveals extensive disease not amenable to optimal cytoreduction, would you recommend neoadjuvant chemotherapy"

        "text": "1. Yes, intraoperative ascites sampling for cytology is recommended if present, as positive cytology is part of FIGO staging but does not independently alter management if gross disease is present. 2. Fertility-sparing surgery may be considered in select early-stage (IA/IC, unilateral, low-grade) epithelial tumors, but standard staging and debulking is preferred for advanced or high-grade disease. 3. If optimal cytoreduction is not feasible based on imaging or intraoperative findings, neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking is appropriate and supported by current guidelines."

I have a few additional questions and points for clarification as we move forward with this patient\u2019s workup and management: **1. Lymphadenectomy and Omentectomy:** - In the setting of suspected advanced epithelial ovarian cancer, do you recommend systematic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy as part of the initial surgical staging, or is selective sampling sufficient if nodes are not grossly enlarged? - Is infracolic omentectomy always indicated, or are there scenarios where a biopsy alone is sufficient? **2. Genetic Testing and Counseling:** - Given the implications for both treatment and family risk, would you recommend sending tissue for BRCA1/2 and other homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) testing at the time of surgery, or should this be deferred until histopathology confirms epithelial ovarian cancer? - Should we refer the patient for genetic counseling preoperatively, or wait until a definitive diagnosis is established? **3"

Infracolic omentectomy is standard for staging and cytoreduction\u2014biopsy alone is reserved for unresectable disease or poor surgical candidates. 2. Send tissue for BRCA1/2 and HRD testing at the time of surgery if epithelial ovarian cancer is strongly suspected, as results impact adjuvant therapy; genetic counseling can be offered preoperatively if suspicion is high, but is essential once diagnosis is confirmed. Any further questions on perioperative management or adjuvant therapy planning?"

    "specialist_reason": "An oncologist is the most appropriate specialist in this scenario because the patient has a large ovarian mass accompanied by significant ascites (fluid in the abdomen). These findings are highly concerning for a possible ovarian malignancy (ovarian cancer), especially given the associated symptoms of increasing abdominal girth, shortness of breath, early satiety, and fatigue. Oncologists, particularly gynecologic oncologists, are the specialists trained to evaluate, diagnose, and manage suspected or confirmed cancers of the ovary. They can coordinate further diagnostic workup (such as tumor markers, advanced imaging, and biopsy if needed) and initiate appropriate treatment, including surgery and chemotherapy if cancer is confirmed. Therefore, referral to an oncologist is the most relevant next step."
