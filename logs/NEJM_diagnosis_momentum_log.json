The absence of mucosal involvement, pruritus, and systemic symptoms makes lichen planus pigmentosus and ashy dermatosis less likely, but if histology shows interface dermatitis or a lichenoid pattern, reconsider these; post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation is less likely given the progressive, ashy/blue-gray hue and thickening."

Dermoscopy in ochronosis may reveal bluish-gray globules, banana-shaped structures, and telangiectasia, while LPP/ashy dermatosis show more homogeneous pigment and possible Wickham striae. For counseling, I emphasize that improvement is slow and often incomplete even after stopping hydroquinone; adjuncts like topical retinoids, chemical peels (with caution), and Q-switched lasers may help, but results are variable and require realistic expectations."

To summarize, we have a patient with a persistent, non-productive cough for six months, mild exertional dyspnea, no constitutional symptoms (no fever, weight loss, night sweats), no history of asthma, allergies, GERD, or environmental exposures, and no medication triggers. Imaging reveals mediastinal lymphadenopathy and diffuse ground-glass opacities with a crazy paving pattern. Transbronchial biopsy shows noncaseating granulomas, and infectious workup is negative. Given these findings, my leading consideration is **sarcoidosis**, particularly pulmonary sarcoidosis, given the noncaseating granulomas, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and lack of infectious etiology. The crazy paving pattern, while classically associated with alveolar proteinosis, can also be seen in sarcoidosis, especially with interstitial involvement.

For therapeutic escalation in stable, non-ulcerated NL, options include topical or intralesional corticosteroids, but if lesions progress or ulcerate, consider phototherapy, systemic agents (e.g., pentoxifylline, antiplatelet drugs), or multidisciplinary input."

A few points and questions to further refine our approach: 1. **Skin Biopsy**: I agree this is crucial. If the biopsy demonstrates mucin deposition with increased fibroblasts and fibrosis, that would strongly support scleromyxedema. If the findings are more consistent with dermal sclerosis without mucin, systemic sclerosis would be favored. 2. **Autoimmune Serologies**: If ANA, Scl-70, and centromere antibodies are negative, that would further support scleromyxedema over systemic sclerosis. However, I understand that seronegative systemic sclerosis can occur, albeit rarely. 3. **Systemic Involvement**"

Are there specific factors (e.g., degree of muscle atrophy, fixed flexion deformity) that would influence the decision for surgery or expected prognosis? 2. **Imaging:** Would you recommend MRI of both knees as the gold standard, or would high-resolution ultrasound suffice for confirming tendon discontinuity in this chronic setting? Are there particular MRI sequences or findings we should highlight for the radiologist? 3. **Rehabilitation"

Would you recommend any additional laboratory screening (e.g., CK, inflammatory markers) to definitively exclude a subclinical myopathic process, or is the clinical picture sufficiently specific? 2. **Chronicity and Surgical Referral:** In your experience, are there particular clinical or imaging features that would suggest a poor prognosis for surgical repair (e.g., complete fatty replacement of the quadriceps on MRI, severe fixed flexion contracture)?

The complexity, chronicity, and resistance to standard therapies indicate the need for expert evaluation, diagnosis, and management of skin diseases\u2014precisely the expertise of a dermatologist."

There is no evidence of similar lesions elsewhere, and the patient denies any prior history of linear dermatoses. Does this further support Koebnerization secondary to chronic scratching, or would you still recommend considering a linear dermatosis in the differential? 2. **Therapeutic Approach:** - Given the lack of response to OTC hydrocortisone, would you recommend starting with a superpotent topical steroid (e.g., clobetasol) under occlusion as first-line, or would you consider adding a topical"

Histopathologically, CEP shows eosinophilic infiltration of alveolar spaces and interstitium without vasculitis or granulomas (which would suggest EGPA or other entities). Additional workup to further exclude EGPA could include repeat ANCA testing, cardiac evaluation, and peripheral nerve assessment if new symptoms arise; hypereosinophilic syndrome workup may be considered if there is extrapulmonary involvement or persistent eosinophilia despite therapy."

I agree that the clinical and radiologic picture is highly characteristic of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP), and the absence of extrapulmonary involvement or vasculitic features makes EGPA and hypereosinophilic syndrome less likely at this time. A few follow-up points and questions for your input: 1. **Steroid Dosing and Duration:** - What initial corticosteroid regimen do you recommend (e.g., prednisone dose and taper schedule) for CEP in this scenario? - How soon would you expect to see clinical and radiographic improvement, and what is your preferred monitoring strategy (symptoms, labs, repeat imaging)? 2. **Relapse Prevention and Long-term Management:** - Given the high relapse rate in CEP, do you recommend maintenance therapy or a slow taper, and for how long? - Are there any adjunctive therapies or steroid-sparing agents you consider in recurrent"

Clinical improvement is often seen within days, with radiographic and eosinophil normalization expected within 2\u20134 weeks; monitor symptoms, CBC with differential, and chest imaging at 2\u20134 week intervals initially. Due to relapse risk, a slow taper is preferred, and in recurrent cases, consider inhaled corticosteroids or steroid-sparing agents (e.g., methotrexate, azathioprine); maintenance low-dose oral steroids may be needed for frequent relapses."

A few points and questions for further clarification: 1. **Steroid Use and Post-Transplant Changes:** Given the patient\u2019s history of prolonged topical steroid use after corneal transplantation, do you think there is a significant risk that the scarring could be iatrogenic (medication-induced), or is the pattern and progression more typical of an autoimmune process like OCP? Have you seen similar presentations from chronic topical medication toxicity or post-surgical changes alone? 2. **Biopsy Considerations:** For the conjunctival biopsy, do you recommend sampling from an area of"

The hoarseness is chronic, has not improved, and is accompanied by a sensation of throat scratchiness and occasional feeling of something in the throat, but without other neurological or systemic symptoms.

On laryngoscopy, malignancy often appears as irregular, exophytic, or ulcerative lesions; benign lesions are usually smooth and symmetric, while vocal cord paralysis presents as impaired or absent movement, often with glottic gap or bowing. 3. Even mild GERD can contribute to chronic laryngeal irritation, so empiric reflux management may be reasonable, but persistent hoarseness still mandates visualization to rule out structural pathology."

The patient also reports balance issues and has had an MRI of the brain, further indicating concern for a central nervous system process. While the patient has a history of kidney disease and is on cyclosporine (which can cause neurological side effects such as PRES\u2014posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome), the evaluation and management of acute neurological symptoms, seizure disorders, and interpretation of brain imaging fall squarely within the expertise of a neurologist. Thus, a neurologist is best equipped to diagnose and manage the underlying neurological condition, determine if the symptoms are medication-related, and coordinate further care."

While NSTI can spread along fascial planes and may not always originate at the incision, does this distribution raise your suspicion for hematogenous seeding (e.g., bacteremia with secondary skin involvement), or could this represent a toxin-mediated process (such as staphylococcal or streptococcal exotoxins)? 2. **Role of Imaging**: If the CT scan shows no obvious gas or deep fascial involvement, but the clinical picture remains highly suspicious, would you still advocate for surgical exploration?

The focal tenderness in the mid-forearm and pain with pronation/supination suggest possible involvement of the pronator teres, supinator, or flexor muscle group. - Would you recommend early ultrasound to assess for partial tendon tear or hematoma if the radiographs are negative and symptoms persist? 2. **Compartment Syndrome**: - While the patient currently lacks severe pain, neurological deficits, or pain out of proportion, I am mindful of the risk of evolving"

For exposures, a detailed re-review of occupational, avocational, and home exposures (including birds, molds, hot tubs) is worthwhile. Imaging features such as upper/mid-lung predominance, mosaic attenuation, or air trapping may suggest hypersensitivity pneumonitis, while centrilobular nodules or more diffuse ground-glass may point toward smoking-related ILDs; classic IPF (UIP) usually shows basal and subpleural reticulation and honeycombing.

The patient's significant smoking history further increases the risk for chronic lung diseases. Pulmonologists are experts in diagnosing and managing complex lung conditions such as interstitial lung disease, pulmonary fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other causes of abnormal chest imaging. The mention of a possible lung biopsy and the need for specialized interpretation of advanced imaging also fall squarely within the pulmonologist's expertise.

For example, is the relatively acute onset and progressive distension more characteristic of volvulus, or can neoplasm present similarly if it causes complete obstruction? - Would you expect more intermittent, colicky pain with volvulus, or can it present with a dull, constant ache as in this case? **2.

There is no personal or family history of liver disease, autoimmune conditions, or hormonal disorders. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated so far, with normal blood pressure and no gestational diabetes or preeclampsia. She is not on any new medications except prenatal vitamins, and there are no other skin findings (no spider angiomas, rashes, or bruising). **My initial thoughts:** - The most likely diagnosis appears to be **palmar erythema of pregnancy**, which is a benign and physiological finding due to increased estrogen levels during pregnancy.

Reason: An Infectious Disease specialist is the most appropriate referral in this case because the patient is a premature newborn presenting with multiple concerning symptoms: clusters of painful blisters around the mouth, nose, eyes, and abdomen; oral and nasal sores; eye irritation; fever; feeding difficulties; lethargy; and abnormal movements. These symptoms strongly suggest a serious systemic infection, with neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) being a leading concern due to the distribution of lesions (including periorbital and mucosal involvement), the patient's age, and the risk of rapid progression to severe disease (encephalitis, sepsis, or disseminated infection) in neonates, especially those born prematurely. An Infectious Disease specialist is best equipped to: - Rapidly diagnose and manage complex or life-threatening infections in newborns. - Guide urgent diagnostic testing (e.g., HSV PCR, blood cultures, lumbar puncture). - Initiate and monitor appropriate antiviral therapy. - Coordinate multidisciplinary care (including ophthalmology and neurology"

I agree this is a highly concerning presentation, especially given the patient\u2019s age (a few days old, born at 32 weeks), prematurity, and constellation of symptoms: grouped vesicular lesions (blisters) around the mouth, nose, eyes, and abdomen; mucosal involvement (oral and nasal sores); eye irritation with photophobia and discharge; fever; feeding difficulties; decreased urine output; lethargy; and some abnormal movements (jerking). There are also signs of possible dehydration and abdominal distension. **Key points:** - No known maternal history of HSV or visible lesions, but as you know, maternal HSV can be asymptomatic. - No family history of immunodeficiency. - No other sick contacts. - No prior vaccinations (as expected for age). - Some blisters are crusting, but no necrosis or dark centers. - No vomiting or diarrhea, but some abdominal swelling. - Neurological symptoms: increased sleepiness,"

A few points and questions to further refine our management and ensure we are not missing any co-infections or alternative diagnoses: 1. **Clinical Course and Monitoring:** - The patient remains lethargic with intermittent abnormal movements, but no overt seizures have been observed. Would you recommend starting empiric anticonvulsant therapy at this stage, or should we await EEG/neuroimaging findings? - Are there specific neurological signs or laboratory markers you would prioritize for monitoring progression or complications of HSV encephalitis in this context? 2. **Differential Diagnosis:** - While disseminated HSV is the leading diagnosis, are there any other infectious or non-infectious etiologies you would consider given the distribution of lesions (e.g., congenital varicella, enterovirus,"

Key neurological signs to monitor include changes in mental status, new focal deficits, persistent abnormal movements, and bulging fontanelle; labs to follow include serial LFTs, CBC, and coagulation profile for evidence of multi-organ involvement. Differential diagnoses to consider include congenital varicella (look for maternal history, \u201cdew drop\u201d lesions), enterovirus (PCR from CSF/lesions), and less likely bacterial sepsis with skin involvement (e.g., S. aureus), but the clinical picture most strongly supports HSV."

I agree that disseminated HSV remains the most likely diagnosis, but I appreciate your suggestions regarding alternative etiologies and monitoring parameters. A few follow-up points and questions: 1. **Lesion Morphology and Distribution:** - The vesicular lesions are grouped and involve the perioral, perinasal, periocular regions, and abdomen, with mucosal involvement but no classic \u201cdew drop on a rose petal\u201d appearance or widespread trunk/extremity involvement. There is no known maternal varicella history, and no vesicles in various stages of healing. Does this further lower your suspicion for congenital varicella, or would you still recommend VZV PCR from lesions/CSF as part of the workup? 2. **Enterovirus Consideration:** - Enterovirus PCR is pending from CSF and lesions. In your experience, would enterovirus present with such prominent mucocutaneous and ocular involvement, or would you expect"

Enterovirus rarely causes such prominent grouped mucocutaneous and ocular involvement\u2014its neonatal presentations are more often sepsis-like or with meningoencephalitis, so it is less likely but reasonable to rule out with PCR."

I agree that, while congenital varicella is unlikely based on the clinical presentation and maternal history, it is prudent to include VZV PCR in the diagnostic workup given the severity and age of the patient. We have already sent VZV PCR from both lesion swabs and CSF, and will follow up on those results. Regarding enterovirus, I concur that the clinical picture is not typical, but we have included enterovirus PCR from CSF and lesions as part of our comprehensive evaluation. A few additional points and questions to further refine our management: 1. **Ophthalmologic Involvement:** The ophthalmology team has noted conjunctival injection and some periocular vesicles, but no evidence of keratitis or retinitis on initial exam. Are there specific antiviral adjuncts (e.g., topical antivirals) or additional ophthalmologic interventions you would recommend at this stage, or should we continue with systemic acyclovir and close"
