These symptoms have developed over time in areas where the patient has been applying a topical skin-lightening agent (hydroquinone), raising concern for a dermatologic condition such as exogenous ochronosis or another pigmentary disorder. The patient denies systemic symptoms, mucosal involvement, or a history suggestive of internal disease, making a skin-focused specialist most relevant. Dermatologists are experts in diagnosing and managing pigmentary disorders, adverse effects of topical agents, and other skin changes, making them the best choice for further evaluation and management in this case."

Additional histological features supporting ochronosis include dermal fibrosis, pigment incontinence, and a sparse lymphohistiocytic infiltrate; absence of basal layer damage helps distinguish from lichen planus pigmentosus. 3. After biopsy, continue strict sun protection, discontinue hydroquinone, and consider topical retinoids or procedural options (e.g., Q-switched lasers) if ochronosis is confirmed; patient counseling on slow improvement is essential."

For procedural interventions, Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (1064 nm) is the most studied and generally safest for exogenous ochronosis, but results are variable and multiple sessions are often needed; fractional lasers may be considered in select cases, but with greater caution due to risk of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation."

On exam, focus on skin lesions (e.g., erythema nodosum), lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, visual changes, and arrhythmias. 2. Full spirometry with DLCO is appropriate; consider 6-minute walk test if dyspnea is significant. If pulmonary function is only mildly impaired and symptoms are mild, observation is reasonable, with close follow-up. 3. The crazy paving pattern can be seen in sarcoidosis but is not classic; if clinical suspicion for other etiologies (e.g., alveolar proteinosis, organizing pneumonia) is low, no further workup is needed at this time."

For early, non-ulcerated lesions, I typically start with potent topical corticosteroids (e.g., clobetasol ointment under occlusion) to minimize atrophy risk, reserving intralesional triamcinolone for small, active plaques; both can be effective, but intralesional is best for localized, thickened borders. 2. Educate the patient to report any new ulceration, persistent non-healing areas, rapid growth, bleeding, or nodularity\u2014these may signal malignant transformation; I recommend dermatologic follow-up every 6\u201312 months, or sooner if changes occur. 3. For progressive or ulcerated NL, systemic options include low-dose systemic corticosteroids, antiplatelet agents, or immunomodulators (e.g., methotrexate, cyclosporine); these are considered if topical/intralesional therapy fails or ulceration develops."

If a significant pericardial effusion is present, pericardiocentesis with fluid analysis (including cytology and mesothelial markers) is indicated both diagnostically and therapeutically; cardiac MRI is most useful for assessing pericardial thickening, masses, or myocardial invasion if echo findings are equivocal. Clinically significant pericardial involvement in mesothelioma is uncommon but not rare\u2014look for pericardial thickening, nodularity, or mass effect on imaging. 2. If initial cytology/biopsy is non-diagnostic, prioritize broad immunohistochemical panels (including markers for metastatic adenocarcinoma, lymphoma, and rare tumors) and consider repeat or more invasive biopsy if suspicion remains high."

While there have been rare reports of lichenoid reactions to these medications, the patient has not started any new drugs recently.

However, would you recommend including a haptoglobin, LDH, and peripheral smear in the initial workup to definitively rule out hemolysis, or would you reserve this for cases with anemia or indirect hyperbilirubinemia? 3. **Autoimmune Hepatitis:** In the absence of risk"

There is mild abdominal distension, but bowel sounds are present and normal. No peritonism. Would you consider this sufficient to defer imaging for now, or would you recommend a low threshold for imaging given the location and duration of symptoms? 2. **Laboratory Workup:** I plan to order a CBC and CRP as you suggested.

If so, were there any subtle clinical cues that prompted further investigation? 2. **Threshold for Repeat Testing:** If the patient were to develop very mild, intermittent pruritus without other symptoms or lab abnormalities, would you recommend immediate repeat liver function and bile acid testing, or would you observe for progression before initiating further workup? 3. **Patient Counseling:** When discussing benign skin changes with patients, do you find that visual"

For any new pruritus in pregnancy, even if mild or intermittent, I recommend prompt repeat LFTs and bile acids, as ICP can present subtly and early detection is important. 3.

A few points for further discussion and clarification: 1. **Threshold for Bile Acid Testing:** In your practice, do you routinely order serum bile acids alongside LFTs at the first report of pruritus, even if the pruritus is mild and labs are otherwise normal? Or do you reserve bile acid testing for cases where pruritus is persistent or accompanied by abnormal LFTs? I ask because access and turnaround time for bile acid testing can sometimes be a limiting factor. 2. **Autoimmune Screening:** In the rare scenario where palmar erythema persists postpartum or is accompanied by new systemic symptoms (e.g., arthralgias, fatigue), do you have a preferred initial autoimmune workup (e.g., ANA, RF,"

To further refine our shared management approach, I have a few additional questions and thoughts: 1. **Transient Pruritus:** In cases where a patient reports a single episode of mild pruritus (for example, after a hot shower or in the evening), but it resolves and does not recur, would you still recommend bile acid and LFT testing, or would you wait for recurrence or persistence before initiating workup? 2. **Role of Dermatology:** Have you found value in dermatology referral for atypical presentations of palmar erythema in pregnancy (e.g., if the erythema is patchy, associated with scaling, or not classic in appearance), or do you generally manage these cases within obstetrics unless other concerning features arise? 3."

Are there particular complications we should anticipate and monitor for most closely in the next 24\u201348 hours? 2. **Duration of Therapy**: If HSV is confirmed, do you recommend the full 21-day course of IV acyclovir for disseminated disease, even if CNS involvement is not confirmed?

Differential Diagnosis:** While disseminated HSV remains the leading diagnosis, are there any other infectious or non-infectious etiologies you would prioritize at this stage, given the negative initial HSV PCRs and the clinical picture? For example, would you consider congenital CMV, bacterial sepsis with skin manifestations (e.g., staph/strep), or metabolic/genetic disorders in the differential, or do you feel the presentation is sufficiently classic for HSV to focus our efforts there? **2.

I recommend repeating HSV PCRs from blood and lesion swabs at 24\u201348 hours, as viral shedding may increase with disease progression; CSF PCR should be repeated once coagulopathy is corrected and lumbar puncture is safe.
