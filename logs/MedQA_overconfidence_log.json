Are there particular clinical features that would make you more suspicious for MuSK-positive MG in this patient? 2. **Electrophysiological Testing:** Would you prioritize repetitive nerve stimulation or single-fiber EMG as the initial electrophysiological test, given the patient\u2019s prominent ocular and bulbar symptoms?

For ocular/bulbar symptoms, single-fiber EMG is more sensitive and should be prioritized, targeting orbicularis oculi or frontalis; repetitive nerve stimulation can be performed on facial muscles but is less sensitive for purely ocular MG. 3. Chest imaging (CT or MRI) for thymoma screening is recommended for all confirmed MG cases, regardless of antibody status."

Would you recommend any specific monitoring or precautions to reduce the risk of progression to myasthenic crisis while the diagnostic workup is ongoing?

Other differentials to keep in mind include Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, mitochondrial myopathies, and motor neuron disease, but the absence of autonomic symptoms, sensory involvement, and muscle atrophy makes these less likely."

Are there any subtle clinical or imaging features you find particularly helpful in these less classic cases, especially in distinguishing intussusception from other causes of acute abdomen in infants? 2. **Malrotation/Volvulus Considerations:** If imaging is equivocal but there is persistent, significant abdominal tenderness and distension, would you advocate for a low threshold for surgical exploration, even in the absence of classic radiographic findings?

The pain is persistent despite rest and ice, and there is tenderness on examination, but no signs of infection, instability, or systemic illness.

Infectious Disease specialists are experts in diagnosing and managing complex infections, including those occurring in the postpartum period, and are well-equipped to guide appropriate antibiotic therapy, evaluate for potential complications such as sepsis, and coordinate care with other specialists if needed. While obstetricians commonly manage routine postpartum infections, the constellation of symptoms and concern for possible sepsis or complicated infection makes Infectious Disease consultation particularly relevant in this case."

Gastroenterologists are experts in diagnosing and managing disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, including anorectal conditions such as hemorrhoids, rectal bleeding, and other potential causes of lower GI bleeding. They are also trained to perform further diagnostic procedures (such as colonoscopy, if indicated) to rule out other serious causes of rectal bleeding, especially in patients without a prior history of hemorrhoids or colorectal screening. Therefore, referral to a gastroenterologist ensures comprehensive evaluation, appropriate management, and follow-up for the patient's symptoms."

Gastroenterologists are experts in diagnosing and managing disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, including anorectal conditions such as hemorrhoids, rectal bleeding, and other potential causes of lower GI bleeding. They are also trained to perform further diagnostic procedures (such as colonoscopy, if indicated) to rule out other serious causes of rectal bleeding, especially in patients without a prior history of hemorrhoids or colorectal screening. Therefore, referral to a gastroenterologist ensures comprehensive evaluation, appropriate management, and follow-up for the patient's symptoms."

I counsel patients that recovery may take 3\u20134 months, with risks of stiffness, incomplete flexion, or need for further surgery; early and dedicated hand therapy is crucial. 4.

The straight leg raise test is positive, and there are no vascular or systemic symptoms. **My initial impression is that this is most consistent with an acute lumbar radiculopathy, likely due to a herniated lumbar disc, possibly at the L4-L5 or L5-S1 level, given the lateral leg and foot involvement.** **Differential diagnoses include:** - Acute lumbar disc herniation with nerve root compression (most likely) - Lumbar nerve root irritation without frank herniation (e.g., due to muscle spasm"

A few follow-up points for your input: 1. **Transient Paresthesia Without Weakness:** Given that the patient currently has only paresthesia and no objective weakness, is there any evidence that early intervention (e.g., a short course of oral steroids) could hasten recovery or reduce the risk of developing motor deficits, or is conservative management with NSAIDs and activity modification still preferred? 2. **Physical Therapy Timing:** Would you recommend initiating physical therapy early (within the first week or two), or do you prefer to wait until the acute pain subsides somewhat before starting formal rehabilitation? 3. **Red Flag Monitoring"

Ocular Symptoms:** The patient describes intermittent eye redness and irritation without pain or discharge, which is suggestive of conjunctivitis rather than uveitis. However, given the association of reactive arthritis with both conjunctivitis and anterior uveitis, would you recommend routine ophthalmology referral at this stage, or only if the patient develops new symptoms such as photophobia, significant pain, or visual changes? **2. Duration of Antibiotic Therapy:** For chlamydia-triggered reactive arthritis, some guidelines suggest a longer course of antibiotics (up to 2 weeks) if symptoms are persistent. Would you consider extending doxycycline beyond 7 days if the patient\u2019s joint or urinary symptoms do not resolve promptly, or would you reassess and tailor therapy based on follow-up"

If available, Giardia antigen testing on a single sample is highly sensitive and may suffice, but if resources allow, sending both O&P and antigen on at least one sample (and O&P on three) increases diagnostic yield. If initial tests are negative but suspicion remains high, empiric therapy is reasonable, especially if symptoms persist. Cryptosporidium is a consideration (especially with water exposure), so a multiplex stool PCR or specific antigen test can be added; Entamoeba histolytica is less likely without travel to endemic areas or dysentery.

Reason: A Gynecologic Oncologist is the most appropriate specialist in this case because the patient has a large ovarian mass and significant ascites (fluid in the abdomen). These findings are highly concerning for a possible ovarian malignancy (ovarian cancer) or another gynecologic cancer, even though the CA-125 is normal (as this marker can be normal in some ovarian cancers or in early disease). Gynecologic Oncologists are specifically trained to evaluate, diagnose, and manage cancers of the female reproductive system, including ovarian tumors. They have expertise in both the surgical and medical management of these conditions, as well as in coordinating further diagnostic procedures such as paracentesis and advanced imaging. Early referral to a Gynecologic Oncologist is crucial for optimal diagnosis, staging, and treatment planning in suspected ovarian cancer or other gynecologic malignancies."

A few points and questions for further discussion: **1. Differential Diagnosis:** While ovarian malignancy (epithelial or non-epithelial) is at the top of the list, are there specific benign etiologies you would still consider likely in this scenario (e.g., Meigs syndrome, massive endometrioma, tubo-ovarian abscess, or rare infectious causes)?

Would you also recommend checking estradiol or testosterone, given the possibility of hormonally active sex cord-stromal tumors, or would you reserve those for cases with clinical signs of hormonal excess? 2. **Imaging:** Given the lack of CT imaging so far, I will expedite a CT of the abdomen and pelvis for further characterization of the mass, assessment of peritoneal disease, and surgical planning.

Tumor Marker Interpretation and Next Steps:** If the additional tumor markers (AFP, LDH, hCG, inhibin) return within normal limits, would you recommend proceeding directly to surgical exploration, given the persistent high suspicion for malignancy based on imaging and clinical presentation?

Surgical Planning:** Assuming imaging confirms a large, complex ovarian mass with ascites but no clear evidence of extra-ovarian disease, would you recommend primary surgical management (exploratory laparotomy/laparoscopy with mass removal and staging), or would you consider neoadjuvant chemotherapy in any scenarios for a premenopausal patient with this presentation? **3.
