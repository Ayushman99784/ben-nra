In your experience, how often are these classic findings absent, and would their absence lower your suspicion for intussusception? 2. **Alternative Diagnoses:** If the ultrasound is negative for intussusception, what would be your next most likely diagnoses? Would you prioritize volvulus, early appendicitis, or other causes (e.g., mesenteric adenitis, omental cyst, or even a metabolic or infectious etiology)? 3. **Laboratory Workup:** While imaging is being arranged, would you recommend any specific laboratory tests (CBC, electrolytes"

The pain is worsened by walking, stairs, and squatting, and is associated with tenderness on palpation, but there is no swelling, instability, locking, or systemic symptoms. These features suggest a musculoskeletal injury or overuse condition (such as a ligament, tendon, or meniscal issue) rather than a neurological, rheumatological, or infectious cause.

Valgus stress testing is still worthwhile, though may be normal in mild cases. If symptoms persist, start with plain radiographs to rule out bony pathology; MRI is reserved for persistent, unexplained pain or suspicion of internal derangement."

For example, would you recommend McMurray\u2019s or Thessaly\u2019s test at this stage, or is their sensitivity limited in mild presentations? 2. **Role of Bracing or Taping:** Do you find any benefit in using a knee sleeve, soft brace, or taping techniques for symptomatic relief or support in cases of pes anserine bursitis, or is this generally unnecessary? 3. **Patient Education:** Are there specific educational points you emphasize with patients"

A knee sleeve or soft brace may provide subjective comfort but is not essential; taping is rarely necessary. 3.

While these could represent dermal melanocytosis (Mongolian spots), I am concerned about the possibility of storage material deposition, as seen in some lysosomal storage disorders. - In your experience, are there specific characteristics (e.g., texture, distribution, associated findings) that help distinguish between benign dermal melanocytosis and the skin findings of storage disorders in neonates? 2. **Ocular Findings:** - The cloudy corneas are concerning. I will arrange a slit-lamp exam, but in your experience, are there particular features (e.g., corneal clouding vs. cataract vs. cherry-red"

For skin findings: Benign dermal melanocytosis (Mongolian spots) are typically flat, slate-blue to gray, well-demarcated, and most often on the sacral/gluteal region, though they can extend to the back and limbs; they are not raised, do not change over time, and lack associated nodularity or induration. In contrast, storage disorder-related lesions may be more widespread, sometimes have a pebbly or thickened texture, and can be associated with other cutaneous findings (e.g., angiokeratomas in Fabry, papular lesions in Hunter). 2. For ocular findings: Corneal clouding (seen in MPS I, VI, VII) is diffuse and involves the entire cornea, while cataracts are localized lens opacities; a cherry-red spot (seen in GM1/GM2 gangliosidosis) is a macular finding with a pale retina and central red fovea.

Surgery for a phyllodes tumor typically involves removing the tumor along with a margin of healthy tissue to reduce the risk of recurrence. Most often, this is done as a lumpectomy (removal of the mass with some surrounding tissue), but in rare cases, a mastectomy (removal of the whole breast) may be considered if the tumor is very large relative to the breast size or if clear margins cannot be achieved. The procedure is usually performed under general anesthesia. Most patients go home the same day or after an overnight stay. Recovery time varies, but many people are able to return to normal activities within 1\u20132 weeks, though you should avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activity for a few weeks.

I will ensure the patient understands the potential need for re-excision or mastectomy if margins are not adequate, and that recurrence risk is closely tied to margin status. A few additional points and questions to further clarify our approach: **1. Oncoplastic Techniques:** Given the tumor\u2019s size (6 cm) and upper outer quadrant location, do you have experience with or recommend oncoplastic techniques to optimize cosmetic outcomes in cases where a large volume of tissue must be excised? Are there specific approaches you find most effective in this scenario? **2. Pathology Communication:** To facilitate optimal margin assessment, do you recommend any specific intraoperative specimen orientation or communication with pathology (e.g., inking, marking margins) that has improved outcomes in your practice? **3.

For large upper outer quadrant tumors, I recommend volume displacement oncoplastic techniques (e.g., lateral mammoplasty, local tissue rearrangement) to preserve contour and symmetry; multidisciplinary planning with a plastic surgeon can be very helpful. 2. I always orient the specimen with sutures and request inking of all margins, providing a diagram to pathology to ensure precise margin assessment. 3. For borderline/malignant phyllodes, I recommend multidisciplinary discussion regarding adjuvant radiotherapy if margins are close or re-excision is not feasible, as this may reduce local recurrence risk."

A few additional points and questions to further refine our approach: **1. Preoperative Planning and Imaging:** - Given the rapid growth and size of the tumor, would you recommend a preoperative breast MRI at this stage to further delineate the extent of disease and assess for any satellite lesions, or do you feel the current imaging is sufficient? - Would you consider any additional imaging (e.g., axillary ultrasound) preoperatively, even in the absence of clinically palpable nodes, or is this unnecessary given the low likelihood of nodal involvement in phyllodes tumors? **2. Surgical Margins and Intraoperative Assessment:** - In your experience, is there any role for intraoperative ultrasound guidance to help achieve adequate margins,"

Surgical Oncologists are experts in the surgical management of tumors, including complex or rare breast tumors like phyllodes tumors. They have the specialized training to perform the necessary surgery (such as wide local excision or, if needed, mastectomy), assess the need for further treatment, and manage any potential complications. Therefore, referral to a Surgical Oncologist ensures the patient receives the most appropriate and expert care for her condition."

Both ceftriaxone and azithromycin are generally safe in breastfeeding. For endometritis, IV antibiotics are typically continued until the patient is afebrile for 24\u201348 hours, then transition to oral therapy to complete a total of 10\u201314 days, depending on clinical response."

The dialogue shows that the doctor has already considered and largely ruled out benign anorectal causes through detailed history and is planning a physical examination and possibly anoscopy. However, given the persistence of symptoms and the need for further evaluation (such as colonoscopy) to rule out more serious gastrointestinal conditions\u2014including colorectal polyps, cancer, or other lower GI pathologies\u2014a Gastroenterologist is best equipped to perform these diagnostic procedures and manage any underlying gastrointestinal disease."

My preferred regimen includes daily fiber supplementation (20\u201330g), increased fluid intake, sitz baths, and minimizing straining; topical agents (e.g., hydrocortisone or witch hazel) can be considered short-term. 3. For colonoscopy, provide standard bowel prep instructions and counsel the patient on the importance of screening, even if symptoms resolve."

How soon after starting AEDs would you recommend follow-up EEG or clinical review? - In your experience, what is the likelihood of achieving seizure freedom in cases like this, and are there any early indicators that might suggest a higher risk of refractory epilepsy? 2. **School and Psychosocial Considerations:** - The patient reports some difficulty with attention at school since the onset of seizures. Would you recommend formal neuropsychological testing at this stage, or would you reserve this for cases where cognitive or academic difficulties persist after seizure control is achieved? - Are there specific resources or counseling you recommend for adolescents and families adjusting to"

Most adolescents with new-onset temporal lobe epilepsy achieve good seizure control with first-line therapy, but early drug resistance, frequent seizures despite adequate dosing, or abnormal neurodevelopment may predict refractory cases. Neuropsychological testing can be deferred unless cognitive/academic issues persist after seizure control; meanwhile, provide school accommodations and refer to epilepsy support organizations (e.g., Epilepsy Foundation) for psychosocial support and education."

Would this influence our long-term management or prognosis? - If the patient were to develop new symptoms (e.g., language disturbance, motor involvement), would this prompt reconsideration of the seizure focus or further imaging? 2. **Sleep-Related Seizures:** - The family has observed some episodes upon awakening. Would you recommend any specific counseling regarding sleep hygiene or nocturnal seizure precautions at this stage? - If nocturnal seizures become more prominent, would you consider ambulatory EEG or sleep study? 3. **Medication Side Effects and Monitoring:**"

The gustatory aura and right temporal EEG findings suggest possible involvement of the mesial temporal structures (e.g., hippocampus, amygdala), but lateral temporal onset cannot be excluded without ictal EEG; this distinction is more relevant if seizures become refractory or surgical evaluation is considered. New symptoms such as language or motor changes would warrant re-evaluation of localization and repeat imaging. For sleep-related seizures, counsel on good sleep hygiene and safety (e.g., avoid sleeping alone, consider seizure monitors); if nocturnal events increase, ambulatory EEG or video-EEG monitoring may be indicated. Monitor for AED side effects (mood, cognition, rash, behavioral changes) and adjust therapy as needed."

I counsel patients that recovery typically takes 3\u20134 months with hand therapy, and while most regain good function, risks include adhesions, loss of flexion, stiffness, and occasionally incomplete strength or motion\u2014these are especially important to discuss with athletes. Postoperatively, I use early protected motion protocols under hand therapy guidance to minimize adhesions and stiffness."

A few final points to clarify and ensure comprehensive care: 1. **Preoperative Considerations:** - Would you recommend any specific laboratory workup (e.g., CBC, coagulation profile) prior to surgery in a healthy young athlete, or is this typically not necessary unless there are risk factors? - Is there any role for preoperative antibiotics in these cases, or are they reserved for open injuries? 2. **Intraoperative Findings and Repair:** - In your experience, how often do you encounter significant tendon retraction that requires a more extensive approach (e.g., palmar incision) versus being able to retrieve and repair the tendon through a distal approach? - Are there any intraoperative factors that would change your postoperative protocol (e.g., poor tendon quality, delayed"

A few points I\u2019d like to clarify and discuss further: 1. **Distribution of Symptoms:** The patient describes pain and tingling radiating down the lateral aspect of the right leg into the foot, with mild weakness more noticeable on toe walking and dorsiflexion. This seems to overlap between L5 (dorsiflexion, lateral leg, dorsum of foot) and S1 (plantarflexion, lateral foot, sole).

Sensory loss over the dorsum of the foot (L5) vs. lateral foot/sole (S1) and diminished ankle reflex (S1) can also help. Straight leg raise (SLR) is sensitive but not specific; consider checking both heel and toe walking, ankle reflexes, and mapping sensory deficits for further localization."

Reason: A Gastroenterologist is the most appropriate specialist because the patient has been experiencing chronic diarrhea and lower abdominal discomfort for four months, with symptoms including loose, sometimes watery stools, mucus in the stool, bloating, gas, urgency, and foul-smelling, hard-to-flush stools. The symptoms began after possible exposure to untreated water, raising suspicion for persistent gastrointestinal infections (such as giardiasis) or other chronic GI conditions. Initial blood and stool tests are unremarkable, and the symptoms are significantly impacting the patient's quality of life. A Gastroenterologist specializes in diagnosing and managing chronic gastrointestinal symptoms, performing advanced diagnostic testing (such as specialized stool studies, endoscopy, or colonoscopy), and treating conditions like chronic infections, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and malabsorption syndromes.

The patient reports a history of swimming in a lake and possible untreated water exposure during a camping trip prior to symptom onset. Routine stool examination and basic blood work are unremarkable. **My initial thoughts and differential:** 1. **Chronic Protozoal Infection (Giardiasis most likely):** - The history of exposure to untreated water, chronicity, bloating, foul-smelling stools, and absence of systemic symptoms are classic for giardiasis. Routine stool exams can miss Giardia unless specifically requested (ova and parasite exam, antigen testing, or PCR). 2. **Post-infectious IBS:** - The patient has"
