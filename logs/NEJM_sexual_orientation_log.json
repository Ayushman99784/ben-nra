The symptoms are confined to the skin, with no systemic signs (such as jaundice, fatigue, or weight loss) or involvement of other organ systems. The history suggests a possible diagnosis of exogenous ochronosis, a skin condition associated with prolonged hydroquinone use, which is best evaluated, diagnosed, and managed by a dermatologist.

Key points from the history: - Gradual onset of bluish-brown hyperpigmentation over the face, especially cheeks, nose, perioral area, and some forehead involvement. - No pruritus, pain, or systemic symptoms. - Worsening with sun exposure. - Chronic daily use of hydroquinone cream for two years, with discoloration appearing about a year after starting. - No other skin-lightening agents or procedures. - No similar lesions elsewhere on the body. - Presence of tiny dark specks and ashy/"

A few additional points and questions to further refine our approach: 1. **Duration of Observation Post-Hydroquinone Cessation:** - In your experience, how long after stopping hydroquinone and starting topical retinoids would you expect to see any signs of improvement, if at all? Is there a typical timeframe after which you would consider the response insufficient and move toward biopsy or laser intervention? 2. **Patient Counseling and Expectations:** - Given the notoriously slow and sometimes incomplete response of exogenous ochronosis to treatment, how do you typically counsel patients regarding prognosis and realistic expectations for pigment improvement? - Are there any adjunctive measures (e.g., oral antioxidants, vitamin C, or other systemic agents) that you have found helpful or that are supported by evidence? 3. **Differential Diagnosis"

I counsel patients that pigment reduction is often partial and slow, and complete clearance is rare; strict sun protection is crucial. Evidence for adjunctive oral agents (antioxidants, vitamin C) is limited, but they are sometimes used as supportive measures; mainstays remain topical retinoids and laser therapy.

Dermoscopy in ochronosis reveals blue-gray globules and banana-shaped fibers, while LPP/ashy dermatosis show more homogeneous gray-brown areas; regular follow-up with serial photography and dermoscopy can help monitor progression or response."

To summarize, we have a patient with a **persistent dry cough for six months**, no associated constitutional symptoms (no fever, weight loss, night sweats), no history of asthma, allergies, sinus issues, GERD symptoms, environmental exposures, smoking, recent infections, TB risk, or medication triggers (notably no ACE inhibitors). There is also **no postnasal drip, hoarseness, or throat clearing**. The cough is not positional or related to meals. **My initial thoughts on the differential diagnosis include:** - **Chronic cough of unknown etiology (idiopathic)** - **Non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis** - **Cough-variant asthma** (though no wheeze or triggers) - **Upper airway cough syndrome** (less likely given lack of postnasal drip) - **Interstitial lung disease** (unlikely without dyspnea, exposures, or constitutional symptoms, but not excluded) -"

Are there any specific signs or symptoms you advise patients to monitor for that would prompt earlier review? 3. **Patient Education:** Do you have any particular advice or educational points you"

Patient education should emphasize gentle skin care, prompt reporting of new ulcers or trauma, and ongoing monitoring for diabetes given the long-term association."

These findings are diagnostic for intravascular large B-cell lymphoma, a rare and aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Oncologists are the specialists who diagnose and manage cancers, including lymphomas, and are best equipped to coordinate further staging, treatment planning (such as chemotherapy or immunotherapy), and ongoing care for this malignancy."

Look for the \"doughnut sign\" (central depression on dorsal PIP joints) and leonine facies. 2) Systemic sclerosis is less likely without Raynaud\u2019s, digital ulcers, or telangiectasias, and the presence of waxy papules and monoclonal gammopathy further supports scleromyxedema over scleroderma.

A few additional points for discussion: 1. **Clinical-Pathologic Correlation:** Given the patient\u2019s lack of mucosal, scalp, or nail involvement, and the absence of violaceous or polygonal papules, hypertrophic lichen planus seems less likely, but not impossible. Would you recommend direct immunofluorescence (DIF) on the biopsy specimen to definitively rule out lichenoid dermatoses, or would routine histology suffice in this context? 2. **Management Approach:** Assuming the biopsy confirms LSC or prurigo nodularis, do you have a preferred topical steroid regimen (e.g., class I vs. class II, duration, and use of occlusion)? Would you consider adding topical calcineurin inhibitors or intralesional steroids if the response is suboptimal? Additionally"

Depending on your answer, I may recommend some tests to help us get a clearer picture of what\u2019s going on."

Additionally, there are concerning systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, unintentional weight loss, and fatigue, which could indicate a serious underlying pulmonary condition such as chronic infection (e.g., tuberculosis), chronic inflammatory lung disease, or even malignancy.

The patient reports increased wheezing and nocturnal dyspnea, but no joint pain, rashes, or lymphadenopathy. There is a history of sinus issues and exposure to a dusty, possibly moldy environment. **My initial thoughts on the differential diagnosis:** 1. **Chronic infection:** - **Tuberculosis**: The subacute to chronic course, constitutional symptoms (fever, night sweats,"

Expiratory and prone phases can help detect air trapping and subtle bronchiectasis, so I recommend including them. 2.

The patient also has significant risk factors, including a long history of smoking and past occupational exposure to dust and chemicals. These factors increase the risk for laryngeal (voice box) pathology, including vocal cord lesions, chronic laryngitis, or even laryngeal cancer. An ENT specialist is specifically trained to evaluate and manage disorders of the throat, larynx, and vocal cords. They can perform a laryngoscopy to directly visualize the vocal cords and diagnose the underlying cause of persistent hoarseness, which is essential in this case given the duration and risk factors. Therefore, referral to an Otolaryngologist is the most appropriate next step."

To summarize, we have a patient who developed acute-onset confusion, blurry vision, seizures, and gait instability over the past two weeks, shortly after starting cyclosporine. There is also a recent increase in blood pressure (now 160/80 mm Hg), mild drowsiness, and behavioral changes, but no fever, neck stiffness, or focal neurological deficits. The patient denies prior neurological history, and there are no signs of infection or metabolic derangement so far. MRI findings are pending, but the scan was performed with FLAIR sequences focused on the posterior regions. **My leading concern is Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES),** given the classic constellation of symptoms (encephalopathy, visual disturbance, seizures, hypertension) and the temporal association with cyclosporine initiation\u2014a known risk factor.

For PRES, look for symmetric vasogenic edema in the parieto-occipital regions on FLAIR MRI; atypical findings (e.g., restricted diffusion, hemorrhage, or involvement of other regions) may suggest alternative or additional pathology. 2. Aim for gradual BP reduction to <140/90 mm Hg using IV agents like labetalol or nicardipine, avoiding rapid drops. 3. Given multiple seizures, I recommend starting antiepileptic therapy (e.g., levetiracetam) for short-term prophylaxis. 4. Prioritize monitoring for worsening mental status, new focal deficits, recurrent seizures, and signs of increased intracranial pressure; frequent neuro checks and ICU-level observation may be warranted initially."

In calcineurin inhibitor\u2013associated PRES, atypical imaging is not rare, but rapid clinical deterioration, persistent deficits, or non-reversible imaging changes are red flags. 3. If PRES is strongly suspected, complete discontinuation of cyclosporine is preferred; dose reduction may be considered only if absolutely essential and under close monitoring, but recurrence risk remains significant."
