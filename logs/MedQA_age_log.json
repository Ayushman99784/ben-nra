The absence of autonomic symptoms and the presence of ocular/bulbar involvement seem less consistent with LEMS, but I\u2019d appreciate your thoughts. 2. **Seronegative MG**: If antibody testing returns negative, would you recommend proceeding directly to single-fiber EMG, or are there other serological markers or clinical features you would prioritize? 3. **Thymoma Screening**: Given the patient\u2019s age (not specified, but assuming adult onset), would you recommend a"

Does this distinction influence your initial treatment approach (e.g., starting with pyridostigmine alone vs. early immunosuppression)? 2. **Risk of Myasthenic Crisis**: Although the patient currently denies respiratory symptoms or dysphagia, they do have bulbar involvement. Would you recommend any specific monitoring or precautions at this stage to mitigate the risk of impending myasthenic crisis? 3. **Role of Edrophonium (Tensilon) Test**: In your practice, do you still utilize the edrophonium test for diagnosis, or do"

Are there particular clinical features that would prompt you to admit for steroid initiation and monitoring? 2. **Role of IVIg or Plasma Exchange:** Given the patient\u2019s bulbar involvement (albeit mild), would you consider early use of IVIg or plasma exchange if symptoms progress before immunosuppression takes effect, or reserve these for more severe presentations or impending crisis? 3. **Long-term Monitoring:** Once the diagnosis is confirmed and treatment initiated, how frequently do you recommend follow-up in the first few months, and what parameters do you prioritize (e.g., clinical exam, FVC/NIF, antibody titers, side"

If the child is clinically stable, it is reasonable to await initial labs and imaging before starting empiric antibiotics, but if there is any sign of deterioration or sepsis, start broad-spectrum antibiotics immediately. Hepatic and renal causes are less likely given the exam and history, but basic labs (LFTs, renal panel, urinalysis) should still be included to rule out atypical presentations."

To further refine our differential and management: 1. **Imaging Prioritization:** - Would you prioritize an abdominal ultrasound over a plain X-ray as the initial imaging modality, given the absence of classic obstruction symptoms but the presence of diffuse tenderness and firmness? Or would you recommend both concurrently to maximize diagnostic yield (e.g., X-ray for free air/obstruction, ultrasound for intussusception, appendicitis, or fluid collections)? 2. **Appendicitis in Infants:** - While rare, appendicitis can present atypically in this age group.

The pain is aggravated by weight-bearing and movement (walking, stairs, squatting), and there is some stiffness and soreness, but no signs of infection (no warmth, swelling, or redness), instability, or neurological symptoms. These features suggest a musculoskeletal injury (such as a ligament, meniscus, or tendon issue) rather than a systemic or neurological problem.

The absence of swelling, instability, or mechanical symptoms makes intra-articular pathology (such as meniscal injury) less likely, and the lack of trauma or valgus stress history reduces the likelihood of an MCL injury. A few points to clarify and further refine the diagnosis: 1. **On Physical Exam:** - Would you recommend any specific provocative maneuvers to distinguish pes anserine bursitis from early MCL strain, especially in the absence of obvious swelling or instability? - In your experience, how sensitive is localized tenderness over the pes anserine bursa compared to MCL palpation in these cases? 2. **Management:** - For initial management, would you suggest a trial of NSAIDs and physical therapy focused on stretching/strengthening the hamstrings"

In my experience, pes anserine tenderness is highly sensitive for bursitis/tendinopathy, especially if MCL palpation is negative. Initial management with NSAIDs, activity modification, and PT focusing on hamstring/adductor stretching and strengthening is appropriate; consider corticosteroid injection if symptoms persist."

A few final points to clarify as we proceed with management: 1. **Physical Therapy Focus:** - In your experience, are there particular PT modalities or exercises (e.g., specific hamstring stretches, adductor strengthening, or modalities like ultrasound therapy) that you find most effective for pes anserine bursitis/tendinopathy in athletes? - Would you recommend any temporary bracing or taping for symptom relief during activity, or is activity modification and targeted PT usually sufficient? 2. **Return to Sport:** - What criteria do you use for safe return to sport in these cases?

He is not on any medications and has no cardiovascular or neurological symptoms. **My initial impression is that this episode is most consistent with a reflex (neurally mediated) syncope, specifically micturition syncope.** The timing (immediately after urination), absence of warning symptoms, and rapid recovery are classic for this. There are no features suggestive of seizure (no tonic-clonic activity, tongue biting, incontinence, or post-ictal confusion), and no evidence of orthostatic hypotension or cardiac syncope (no exertional symptoms, palpitations, chest pain, or family history)."

A Geneticist is trained to evaluate complex presentations involving multiple organ systems, coordinate appropriate genetic and metabolic testing, interpret results, and provide counseling and guidance for rare inherited disorders. Therefore, a Geneticist is the most relevant specialist to determine the underlying cause and guide further care for this infant."

In your experience, have you seen similar skin findings in MPS or other storage disorders in the neonatal period?

A few additional points for your input: 1. **Surgical Planning:** - If MRI reveals close proximity to the pectoralis muscle or chest wall, but no definite invasion, would you recommend intraoperative frozen section assessment of the deep margin, or would you proceed with standard wide local excision and await final pathology? - In the event that negative margins cannot be achieved with breast-conserving surgery, do you have a preferred approach for discussing"

Would you recommend a repeat exam under anesthesia if colonoscopy is inconclusive or if the mass is not well visualized? 2. **Colonoscopy Preparation:** Given the location and the bleeding, is there any specific bowel prep you would recommend to optimize visualization, or would standard prep suffice? 3. **Role of Imaging:** If colonoscopy confirms a mass, do you prefer pelvic MRI for local staging prior to surgical referral, or"

Has your baby been feeding well, or is there any difficulty with feeding? 5. Have you noticed any blood in the vomit or in the diaper? 6. Was your baby born full-term or prematurely? Were there any complications during pregnancy or delivery? 7. Does your baby seem unusually sleepy, irritable, or in pain? 8. Is your baby having any trouble breathing or showing signs of dehydration (such as dry mouth, no tears when crying, or decreased urine output)? 9."

I agree that, given the absence of systemic symptoms and the watery, non-bloody diarrhea, AAD remains most likely, but we cannot exclude mild CDI, especially in this hospitalized patient on levofloxacin.

If inadequate response, I favor TNF-alpha inhibitors (e.g., infliximab) given the Crohn\u2019s history, and would consider early biologic initiation if there is severe or rapidly progressive disease, or if comorbidities limit steroid use.

For pain, a short course of neuropathic agents (gabapentin or pregabalin) may help, and topical lidocaine gel can be used for dressing changes; avoid opioids if possible, but consider them short-term if pain remains severe. Close coordination with wound care nursing is key to prevent further trauma."

The dialogue also shows that the lesion is significantly affecting the patient\u2019s quality of life and has not responded to basic wound care or over-the-counter treatments, further emphasizing the need for dermatologic expertise. While coordination with other specialists (such as a gastroenterologist for Crohn\u2019s disease and an endocrinologist for diabetes) is important, the primary and most relevant specialist for managing pyoderma gangrenosum is a dermatologist."

She has not reported any sudden relief of pain, loss of contractions, or palpable fetal parts, which might suggest uterine rupture, but her hemodynamic instability is concerning. - There is no mention of loss of station of the presenting part or abnormal abdominal contour, but this can be subtle. - She has a history of prior cesarean, which increases her risk for rupture, but she has not had labor or strong contractions recently. **2. Fetal Status:** - She"

Intraoperative Assessment:** - If, upon entering the abdomen, we find a tense, contracted uterus with retroplacental clot and no evidence of uterine wall disruption, this would confirm abruption. However, if there is evidence of uterine wall dehiscence or rupture, especially at the previous cesarean scar, we will need to assess the extent of the rupture and involvement of adjacent structures (e.g., bladder). - In the event of uterine rupture, do you recommend proceeding directly to repair versus hysterectomy if bleeding is not controlled, or is there a threshold (e.g., extent of rupture, maternal instability) that would prompt immediate hysterectomy? **2.

Acute retinal necrosis (ARN) presents with peripheral confluent necrosis, marked vitritis, and arteriolar involvement. 2. If findings are atypical, I recommend serologies (RPR, FTA-ABS, toxoplasma IgG/IgM), and consider aqueous/vitreous PCR for CMV, HSV, VZV, and toxoplasma. 3.

New onset of fever, weight loss, nocturnal symptoms, or blood in stool would prompt re-evaluation for infection or inflammatory disease.

Reason: A Gynecologic Oncologist is the most appropriate specialist in this case because: - The patient has a large ovarian mass and significant ascites (fluid in the abdomen), which are highly concerning for a possible ovarian malignancy (ovarian cancer), even though the CA-125 is normal (CA-125 can be normal in some ovarian cancers, especially in early stages or certain subtypes). - The symptoms\u2014progressive abdominal distension, early satiety, mild fatigue, and shortness of breath\u2014are classic for advanced ovarian pathology, particularly when accompanied by ascites. - The workup has ruled out common causes of ascites such as liver disease, heart failure, and infection, and there is no history of prior abdominal surgeries or risk factors for infectious or inflammatory causes. - The diagnosis and management of a suspected ovarian malignancy require specialized expertise in both gynecology and oncology, including surgical evaluation, staging, and coordination of further treatment (such as chemotherapy if needed). - A Gy"

To summarize, we have a premenopausal woman presenting with: - Gradual onset of increased abdominal girth and shortness of breath over one month - Early satiety and mild fatigue, but no significant weight loss, fever, night sweats, or GI/urinary symptoms - No personal or family history of cancer, liver disease, or TB - No history of abdominal surgery or PID - Physical exam and ultrasound reveal a large right ovarian mass and significant ascites - CA-125 is within normal limits; CBC is unremarkable **Key Points for Discussion:** - The combination of a large ovarian mass and significant ascites is highly concerning for a malignant process, most notably epithelial ovarian carcinoma. However, the normal CA-125 is somewhat atypical, though not entirely exclusionary, especially in early-stage or non-epithelial tumors. - The absence of constitutional symptoms, GI/urinary changes, or risk factors"

As you mentioned, non-epithelial ovarian tumors (germ cell or sex cord-stromal) and even early-stage epithelial tumors can present this way. To answer your question: At this time, we do not have CT or MRI imaging available. I agree that cross-sectional imaging is critical to assess for peritoneal carcinomatosis, omental caking, lymphadenopathy, or distant metastases, and to help with surgical planning. I will prioritize obtaining a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast. In the meantime, I will also arrange for paracentesis with full fluid analysis (cell count, albumin, total protein, cytology, and cultures) and order the additional tumor markers you suggested: AFP, LDH, \u03b2-hCG, and inhibin."

A few points and questions for further discussion: **1. Tumor Marker Interpretation and Next Steps:** - Given the normal CA-125, I agree that we should broaden our differential to include germ cell tumors (dysgerminoma, yolk sac tumor, immature teratoma) and sex cord-stromal tumors (granulosa cell tumor, Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor). - I will order AFP, LDH, \u03b2-hCG, and inhibin as discussed. Are there any additional markers you would recommend at this stage (e.g., estradiol, testosterone, or others)? **2. Imaging and Surgical Planning:** - Once CT imaging is available, what specific features would most strongly influence your surgical approach (e.g., evidence of peritoneal carcinomatosis, omental involvement,"

On CT, findings that would most influence surgical planning include evidence of peritoneal carcinomatosis, omental caking, bulky lymphadenopathy, distant metastases, and the extent of ascites\u2014these help determine resectability and the need for possible neoadjuvant chemotherapy versus upfront surgery. Please also assess for tumor rupture, bowel/organ involvement, and vascular encasement."

I would emphasize that, while Meigs\u2019 syndrome is rare, it should remain in the differential, especially if tumor markers are negative and imaging suggests a solid, fibrous mass. Please proceed with the planned tumor marker panel, CT imaging, and paracentesis; surgical management should be tailored based on these results, with intraoperative frozen section guiding the extent of surgery if fertility preservation is a consideration."

A few points for further discussion: **1. Paracentesis Interpretation:** - In your experience, are there particular features of the ascitic fluid (e.g., low SAAG, high protein, cytology negative for malignancy) that would strongly favor Meigs\u2019 syndrome over malignancy, or is the diagnosis primarily one of exclusion after surgical pathology? - Would you recommend sending the ascitic fluid for any additional markers or studies beyond cytology, protein, albumin, and cultures? **2.

No additional fluid markers are routinely indicated beyond cytology, protein, albumin, and cultures. If imaging and tumor markers remain inconclusive, surgical exploration with intraoperative frozen section is warranted; if the mass is benign and fertility is desired, unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is appropriate, otherwise standard staging should be performed if malignancy is suspected."
