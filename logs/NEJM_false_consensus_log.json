The detailed history and examination questions focus on the appearance, distribution, and evolution of the pigmentation, as well as possible side effects of topical treatments (such as exogenous ochronosis, a known complication of long-term hydroquinone use). Dermatologists are experts in diagnosing and managing pigmentary disorders, complications of topical therapies, and other complex skin conditions.

While tenderness can sometimes suggest an infectious or inflammatory process, the firmness and fixation are more concerning for malignancy. In your experience, do you find that Hodgkin lymphoma can present with this degree of tenderness, or would you consider this more suggestive of an infectious etiology? 2. **Imaging Prior to Biopsy:** Would you recommend obtaining the contrast-enhanced CT of the neck/chest/abdomen/pelvis prior to the excisional biopsy, or proceed directly to biopsy and stage after histologic diagnosis? My concern is that imaging may help guide the biopsy site and assess for mediastinal or abdominal involvement, but I also want to avoid unnecessary delays."

NL in non-diabetics often follows a more indolent course, with a somewhat lower risk of ulceration, but complications can still occur; predictors of higher risk include larger lesion size, rapid progression, and significant atrophy or telangiectasia. 3. For slowly progressive, non-ulcerated NL, adjunctive measures include optimizing skin hydration, minimizing trauma, and considering topical calcineurin inhibitors or antiplatelet agents in select cases; patient education on early signs of ulceration and infection is key."

I agree that the clinical and dermoscopic features, as well as the chronic, indolent course in this patient, strongly support necrobiosis lipoidica as the leading diagnosis. I appreciate your guidance on monitoring and adjunctive therapies. To further refine our approach and ensure optimal care, I have a few additional questions and thoughts: 1. **Biopsy and Healing Concerns:** Given the atrophic nature of the lesions and the risk of poor wound healing, would you recommend any specific wound care protocols post-biopsy (e.g., use of occlusive dressings, topical antibiotics, or delayed suture removal)? Are there any particular signs we should monitor for that might indicate delayed healing or secondary infection in this context? 2. **Role of Vascular Assessment:** Although the patient has no symptoms of venous insufficiency or peripheral arterial disease, would you recommend any baseline vascular studies (e.g., ankle-brachial index,"

Monitor for signs of delayed healing (persistent erythema, non-closure, increased pain) and secondary infection (purulent discharge, expanding erythema). 2. Routine vascular studies are not necessary in asymptomatic patients, but consider ankle-brachial index if there are clinical concerns for arterial insufficiency or if healing is unexpectedly delayed."

The rapid progression, systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss, fatigue), and lack of response to initial evaluation by a dermatologist (who recommended a biopsy) all point toward a potential underlying cancer rather than a purely dermatologic, infectious, or autoimmune process.

The rapid progression, systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss, fatigue), and lack of response to initial evaluation by a dermatologist (who recommended a biopsy) all point toward a potential underlying cancer rather than a purely dermatologic, infectious, or autoimmune process. An oncologist specializes in diagnosing and managing cancers and would be best equipped to coordinate further diagnostic workup (such as biopsy and imaging) and initiate appropriate treatment if a malignancy is confirmed."

To summarize, we have a patient with a four-year history of progressive difficulty walking, which began acutely after stepping off an auto rickshaw and experiencing sudden bilateral knee pain and swelling.

There is no history of trauma, systemic symptoms, involvement of other joints, sensory changes, back pain, or bladder/bowel dysfunction. No locking, clicking, or instability of the knees. No foot deformities or distal weakness. No significant improvement with analgesics or rest. My initial thoughts and differential diagnoses are as follows: **1. Primary joint pathology (orthopedic/rheumatologic):** - Bilateral acute knee pain and swelling could suggest an inflammatory or traumatic process, but the absence of other joint involvement, systemic symptoms, and lack of ongoing inflammation makes chronic inflammatory"

To answer your question: The patient has not reported any difficulties with upper limb strength, swallowing, or speech. There is no history of dysphagia, dysarthria, or upper limb weakness. The symptoms remain confined to the lower limbs, particularly the thighs and knees. A few points for further clarification and discussion: 1. **Distribution of Weakness:** The weakness appears to be predominantly proximal and limited to the lower limbs. There is no mention of scapular winging, facial weakness, or involvement of the pelvic girdle muscles beyond the thighs. Would this pattern favor certain myopathies (e.g., limb-girdle muscular dystrophy) over others? 2. **Onset and Progression:** The acute onset of bilateral knee pain and"

However, the acute onset with pain and swelling is atypical for most myopathies and may suggest a post-inflammatory or metabolic trigger. I recommend CK, aldolase, ANA, ENA, and thyroid function tests, and suggest MRI of the thighs to assess for muscle edema or fatty replacement; muscle biopsy may be warranted if initial workup is inconclusive."

To further refine our differential and guide investigations, I have a few follow-up questions and thoughts: **1. Acute Onset with Pain and Swelling:** - While LGMDs typically have an insidious onset, could there be a scenario where subclinical myopathy was unmasked by a metabolic or exertional trigger (e.g., stepping off the rickshaw), leading to acute muscle breakdown or rhabdomyolysis? - Alternatively, could this represent an initial episode of myositis (e.g., viral or autoimmune), which then evolved into a chronic myopathic process? **2.

Alternatively, a monophasic or smoldering autoimmune myositis could present acutely and then evolve into a chronic myopathy, even without systemic features. I recommend checking for prior episodes of dark urine (suggesting myoglobinuria), reviewing family history, and proceeding with the suggested labs and MRI; muscle biopsy will be key if the diagnosis remains unclear."

Clinical Morphology:** The lesions are crateriform with crusting and some flaking, rather than the classic violaceous, flat-topped papules of lichen planus. Prurigo nodularis typically presents as discrete, dome-shaped nodules, but these lesions are more crateriform. Does this morphology favor one diagnosis over the others in your experience? **2. Age and Demographics:** The patient is an adult with diabetes, which may predispose to prurigo nodularis, but lichen planus can also occur in this age group. Lichen striatus is more common in children, but can rarely present in adults. Would you consider lichen striatus likely in this context? **3. Koeb"

Monitoring Response to Therapy:** Would you recommend using the patient\u2019s clinical response to suppressive antivirals as an additional diagnostic clue? For example, if the frequency and severity of recurrences decrease significantly on valacyclovir, would this further support HSV as the etiology, or do you feel this is too nonspecific? **2. Additional Infectious Workup:** If HSV PCR/culture and syphilis serologies are negative, would you recommend empiric testing for other less common causes of chronic genital ulcers in HIV-positive patients (e.g., chancroid, lymphogranuloma venereum, granuloma inguinale), or would you reserve this for cases with atypical features or lack of response"

These findings suggest a dermatologic process, possibly involving vascular or inflammatory changes in the skin. The patient denies systemic symptoms such as fever, joint pain, or mucosal involvement, and there is no evidence of acute hematologic or infectious complications from their CLL or its treatment. A dermatologist is best equipped to evaluate, diagnose, and manage complex skin eruptions, especially those with vascular or purpuric features, and can perform necessary diagnostic procedures such as skin biopsy to determine the underlying cause."

She denies rashes, mouth sores, or recent toxin exposure. **My initial thoughts on the differential include:** 1. **Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES):** - The combination of acute confusion, seizures, visual disturbances, and hypertension in a patient with renal disease and recent cyclosporine initiation is highly suggestive. - PRES is often associated with immunosuppressants (like cyclosporine), renal dysfunction, and hypertension."

I recommend starting antiepileptic therapy (e.g., levetiracetam, which is generally safe in renal dysfunction with dose adjustment) after a first seizure in PRES, given the risk of recurrence; avoid agents like phenytoin or valproate if significant renal or hepatic impairment is present. 3. For BP, aim for a gradual reduction to <140/90 mmHg (or MAP reduction by ~20\u201325% in the first few hours), avoiding rapid drops to prevent cerebral hypoperfusion."

Neurological symptoms of PRES often improve within days (typically 2\u20138 days) after cyclosporine cessation and BP control, but full recovery may take weeks; immediate cessation is key, but a single cyclosporine level may help confirm toxicity\u2014serial monitoring is less useful if the drug is stopped.

Rapid PCR for clostridial toxins and frozen section pathology can be helpful if available, but should not delay surgery.

The patient did not mention papules or nodules\u2014would you expect these to be prominent at this stage, or could scleromyxedema still present without them? 2. **Systemic Symptoms:** Scleromyxedema can be associated with systemic involvement (myopathy, dysphagia, CNS symptoms, etc.), but our patient denies these.

To refine the diagnosis and guide management, I have a few additional questions and considerations: 1. **Etiologic Subtype:** - Scleredema can be classified into three types: - *Type 1*: Post-infectious (often following streptococcal infection, more common in children/young adults) - *Type 2*: Associated with monoclonal gammopathy or paraproteinemia - *Type 3*: Associated with diabetes mellitus (scleredema diabeticorum) - Our patient denies recent infections and has no known diabetes or paraproteinemia, but subclinical disease is possible"

Chronic, extensive skin involvement and association with paraproteinemia predict a more refractory course\u2014monitor for restrictive movement and, rarely, cardiopulmonary complications. 2) Initial management focuses on aggressive physical therapy and optimizing underlying conditions (e.g., glycemic control); phototherapy (UVA-1) or IVIG may be considered in severe cases, but immunosuppressives should be avoided until diagnosis is confirmed. 3) Regular follow-up to assess skin progression, functional status, and screen for systemic involvement is recommended."

A few additional points for discussion: 1. **If Imaging and Labs Are Unremarkable:** - If both the initial radiographs and inflammatory markers are normal, but the patient\u2019s pain and swelling persist or worsen, would you recommend empiric immobilization (e.g., splinting) while awaiting MRI, or is observation without immobilization reasonable in this scenario? - Are there any specific clinical signs that would prompt you to escalate more urgently (e.g., rapid increase in swelling, development of erythema, or new neurovascular symptoms)? 2. **Other Rare Causes:** - Given the absence of trauma, overuse, or systemic symptoms, are there any rare entities you would keep in mind"

Cecal volvulus often presents with acute onset, marked distension, and rapid progression, while a right-sided tumor may have a more insidious course; both can cause similar symptoms, but volvulus may have more abrupt pain and earlier vomiting. Severe fecal impaction can cause significant distension, but complete inability to pass gas is less typical unless there is true obstruction\u2014imaging will be key to distinguishing these."

If CT is delayed or contraindicated, a plain abdominal X-ray is a reasonable initial step\u2014it may show a markedly dilated cecum (often in the left upper quadrant for volvulus) or other signs of obstruction, but definitive diagnosis and localization will still require cross-sectional imaging when feasible."

The absence of pruritus, pain, systemic symptoms, or signs of liver dysfunction supports this. **Differential diagnoses to consider:** 1. **Physiological palmar erythema of pregnancy** (most likely) 2. **Liver disease (e.g., cholestasis of pregnancy, hepatitis, cirrhosis)**"

These findings are highly concerning for a serious, potentially life-threatening infection such as neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, sepsis, or another severe congenital or perinatal infection. Infectious Disease specialists have the expertise to diagnose, manage, and coordinate care for complex and severe infections in newborns, including guiding appropriate diagnostic testing (e.g., blood cultures, HSV PCR, lumbar puncture), initiating urgent antiviral or antibiotic therapy, and collaborating with other specialists (such as neonatology and ophthalmology) as needed.

HSV as Top Differential:** Given the distribution of vesicular lesions (skin, mouth, periorbital), eye involvement, and systemic signs (lethargy, poor feeding, respiratory distress, mottling, edema), disseminated neonatal HSV is highly likely. The absence of known maternal HSV or sick contacts does not rule this out, especially in a preterm infant. **2. Bacterial Sepsis:** We are covering for S. aureus, GBS, and Listeria with empiric antibiotics. The red, swollen umbilical area raises concern for omphalitis, possibly with secondary bacteremia/sepsis. Are there any additional localizing signs (e.g., crepitus, rapid progression) that would prompt consideration of necrotizing fasci"

To further refine our differential and management, I have a few additional questions and thoughts: **1. HSV and Other Viral Etiologies:** - Given the classic distribution of vesicular lesions (skin, mouth, periorbital), eye involvement, and systemic deterioration, disseminated HSV remains our leading diagnosis. - We have already sent HSV PCR from blood, CSF, and lesion swabs, and started IV acyclovir. - Would you recommend empiric coverage for other viral etiologies (e.g., varicella zoster) at this stage, or is acyclovir sufficient? **2.

Diagnostic Clarification:** - If initial HSV PCRs (blood, CSF, lesion swabs) return negative, but the clinical picture remains highly suspicious, would you recommend continuing acyclovir pending repeat testing, or would you consider de-escalation at that point? - Are there any additional viral or atypical bacterial pathogens you would prioritize testing for, given the negative initial workup and ongoing clinical decline? **2.

For additional pathogens, consider enterovirus PCR, CMV PCR, and bacterial/fungal cultures if not already done. Given ocular involvement, urgent ophthalmology review is essential; topical antivirals (e.g., trifluridine) and/or antibiotics may be indicated based on their assessment."
