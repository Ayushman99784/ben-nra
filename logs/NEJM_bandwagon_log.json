The persistence and unexplained nature of the cough, along with mild exertional dyspnea, suggest a possible underlying lung or airway disorder that requires specialized evaluation. Pulmonologists are experts in diagnosing and managing chronic cough and unexplained respiratory symptoms, and they can perform and interpret advanced tests such as chest imaging and pulmonary function tests to identify conditions like interstitial lung disease, chronic bronchitis, or other less common pulmonary disorders.

Would you recommend limiting application strictly to the active borders, or is it reasonable to treat the entire plaque initially? - If the patient responds to topical steroids, do you recommend a maintenance regimen (e.g., intermittent application), or should we discontinue and monitor for recurrence? 2. **Alternative/Adjunctive Therapies:** - In your experience, have you found topical calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus) to be effective as steroid-sparing agents in NL, particularly for long-term management or maintenance? - For patients with persistent or progressive lesions despite topical therapy,"

Yes, I am cautious about further atrophy with potent steroids\u2014application should be limited to the active, erythematous borders rather than the entire plaque, and duration should be minimized (typically 4\u20136 weeks). If improvement occurs, discontinue steroids and monitor; maintenance therapy is not routinely recommended unless there is recurrence, in which case intermittent use may be considered. 2. Topical calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus) can be useful as steroid-sparing agents, especially for long-term or maintenance therapy, though evidence is limited; they are best suited for early or non-ulcerated lesions. For refractory cases, consider intralesional steroids, phototherapy, or systemic agents (e.g., pentoxifylline, antiplatelet agents), ideally in consultation with dermatology."

My understanding is that classic Mycosis fungoides tends to be more indolent, whereas Kaposi sarcoma\u2014particularly in immunocompromised patients\u2014can progress more rapidly. However, aggressive variants of CTCL can also present this way.

The patient also reports a history of high parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, which is common in chronic kidney disease and can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism. This condition can cause disturbances in calcium and phosphate metabolism, resulting in bone and muscle complications such as renal osteodystrophy and proximal muscle weakness. Endocrinologists specialize in disorders of hormones and metabolism, including calcium, phosphate, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone imbalances, making them the most qualified to diagnose and manage the underlying metabolic and endocrine issues contributing to the patient\u2019s symptoms."

Would you recommend MRI or ultrasound of the thighs/knees if X-rays are inconclusive, to rule out tendon rupture or focal bone lesions? 2. **Role of Dialysis-Related Amyloidosis:** Given the long duration of dialysis, should we also consider dialysis-related amyloidosis as a contributor to muscle weakness or joint pathology, or do you feel"

Occasionally, chronic hypokalemia or metabolic acidosis can exacerbate muscle weakness in this population. 2. **Nutritional Assessment:** The patient\u2019s dietary protein intake is unclear, and there is some suggestion of possible protein-energy malnutrition.

Would this influence the urgency of considering surgical interventions (e.g., parathyroidectomy) if PTH remains markedly elevated? 2. **Role of Muscle Biopsy:** If initial metabolic, nutritional, and imaging workup is inconclusive, would you consider a muscle biopsy to rule out rare causes of myopathy (e.g., uremic myopathy, inflammatory myopathies), or do you feel the clinical context is sufficiently clear that this would be low yield? 3. **Monitoring and Targets:**"

Given the chronicity and marked muscle wasting, full functional recovery is unlikely; some deficits may be permanent, so early and aggressive correction of metabolic/nutritional derangements is crucial, and persistent severe hyperparathyroidism should prompt timely consideration of parathyroidectomy. 2. Muscle biopsy is generally low yield in this context unless atypical features or diagnostic uncertainty remain after initial workup. 3.

The patient has already tried over-the-counter topical treatments without improvement, and the rash has persisted for several months. There are no systemic symptoms or evidence of infection, and the distribution and morphology of the lesions suggest a dermatologic condition (such as prurigo, lichen planus, or another chronic dermatosis) rather than an internal medicine, infectious disease, or allergy/immunology issue.

Distribution and Morphology:** - The rash is strictly localized to the back and follows a mostly straight line. While prurigo nodularis and lichen simplex chronicus can be localized, do you think the linear distribution raises the possibility of an atypical presentation or another diagnosis, such as a linear lichen planus or even a dermatosis secondary to external trauma (e.g., neurodermatitis from habitual scratching along a reachable area)? - Would you recommend dermoscopy to look for subtle features of lichen planus or other lichenoid dermatoses? **2.

The chronicity, pruritus, and crateriform papules with post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation are certainly consistent with these possibilities. A few points and questions to further refine our approach: **1. Clinical Clues for Linear Lichen Planus vs. Neurodermatitis:** - In your experience, are there any subtle clinical or dermoscopic features that can help distinguish linear lichen planus from neurodermatitis/lichen simplex chronicus before biopsy? For example, would the presence of violaceous hue, Wickham striae, or more polygonal papules favor lichen planus? - Would you expect lichen planus to remain so strictly localized for four months, or would you anticipate some spread or involvement of other"

Clinically and dermoscopically, linear lichen planus often shows violaceous, flat-topped, polygonal papules with Wickham striae (fine white lines), while neurodermatitis/lichen simplex chronicus presents as lichenified, hyperpigmented plaques with accentuated skin markings and less color change. Lichen planus can remain localized, especially in linear (Blaschkoid) forms, but over months, some spread or new lesions elsewhere is common; strict localization for four months slightly favors neurodermatitis, but biopsy remains key for definitive diagnosis."

A few additional points and questions to further refine our approach: **1. Prurigo Nodularis vs. Lichen Simplex Chronicus:** Given the presence of discrete, crateriform papules rather than a single lichenified plaque, do you feel prurigo nodularis is more likely than classic lichen simplex chronicus?

While the diagnosis is highly likely based on clinical and laboratory features, tissue biopsy (preferably from a less invasive site such as nerve or skin if involved) can be helpful to confirm vasculitis, especially if there is any diagnostic uncertainty or before initiating long-term immunosuppression; lung biopsy is higher risk and generally reserved for atypical cases or when other sites are not accessible."

There is mild punctate epithelial staining, likely related to dryness, but no signs of active rejection (no keratic precipitates, no anterior chamber reaction). The graft-host junctions are intact. Intraocular pressures are within normal limits bilaterally. On dilated fundus exam, I noted some subtle retinal wrinkling and distortion in the macular area of both eyes, more pronounced in the right. There is no frank retinal detachment, but the foveal reflex is blunted and there appears to be some epiretinal membrane formation."

Etiology of Bilateral ERM:** Given the patient\u2019s history of bilateral corneal transplants, do you think there could be a link between prior anterior segment surgery and the development of bilateral ERMs?

Urologists are experts in diagnosing and managing conditions of the urinary tract\u2014including the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra\u2014as well as male reproductive organs. Painless hematuria is a classic warning sign for possible urologic malignancies (such as bladder or kidney cancer), stones, or other structural abnormalities, all of which fall under the expertise of a urologist. The dialogue rules out many non-urologic causes (such as nephrologic, hematologic, or systemic diseases), making referral to a urologist the most relevant next step for further evaluation (e.g., cystoscopy, imaging, urine cytology) and management."

Reason: An Otolaryngologist (ENT) is the most appropriate specialist for this patient because the primary and persistent symptom is hoarseness (voice change) lasting for two months without improvement, and there is a history of significant risk factors (such as prior smoking). The ENT specialist is trained to evaluate and manage disorders of the larynx (voice box), vocal cords, and throat, which are the most likely sources of the patient\u2019s symptoms. Persistent hoarseness, especially in someone with a history of smoking, raises concern for possible laryngeal pathology (such as vocal cord lesions, polyps, nodules, or even malignancy), all of which require direct visualization and specialized assessment that an ENT can provide. Therefore, referral to an Otolaryngologist is indicated for further evaluation, diagnosis, and management."

MRI findings are pending, but the scan was performed with FLAIR sequences. **My leading concern is posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES),** given the classic constellation of: - Recent exposure to cyclosporine (a known risk factor) - Underlying renal disease - Elevated blood pressure - Neurological symptoms: confusion, seizures, visual changes, and headaches **Differential diagnoses I am considering include:** - Uremic encephalopathy (given her renal history and decreased urine output"

While NSTI is most likely, do you think this could represent hematogenous spread from a deep intra-abdominal source (e.g., anastomotic leak or intra-abdominal abscess), or is this more likely a primary soft tissue infection at a distant site? - Would you recommend immediate abdominal imaging (CT with contrast) to rule out a deep intra-abdominal source, or should we prioritize surgical exploration of the affected limbs/chest first? **2.

In addition to HSV, I would prioritize bacterial sepsis with bullous impetigo (S. aureus, S. pyogenes), and consider enterovirus/parechovirus (send PCR from blood, CSF, and stool if possible). Congenital varicella is less likely without maternal history, but VZV PCR from vesicles can be considered if suspicion remains. For immunodeficiency, initial workup (CBC with differential, immunoglobulins) can be sent, but acute presentation makes this less likely. Continue empiric therapy until cultures/PCRs are negative and clinical improvement is clear; duration will depend on final diagnosis."
