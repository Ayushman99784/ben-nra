I agree that the clinical picture is highly consistent with Myasthenia Gravis (MG), particularly given the classic features of fluctuating, fatigable weakness with ocular and bulbar involvement, and the absence of sensory, autonomic, or systemic symptoms. A few points and questions to further refine our approach: 1. **Differential Diagnosis:** While MG is the leading diagnosis, are there any features here that would prompt you to consider alternative or coexisting diagnoses, such as Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS), mitochondrial myopathies, or motor neuron disease? The absence of autonomic symptoms and the clear fatigability seem to argue against LEMS, and the lack of sensory involvement or muscle atrophy makes motor neuron disease less likely. Would you recommend any additional screening to rule these out at this stage? 2. **Antibody Testing:** Would you recommend testing for both AChR and"

If initial tests are negative and suspicion remains high, consider LRP4 antibody testing and further electrophysiological studies."

A few additional points for discussion: 1. **Electrophysiological Testing:** Would you prioritize repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) or single-fiber EMG (SFEMG) at this stage, given the prominent ocular and bulbar symptoms? In your experience, is one more sensitive in cases with predominantly ocular or mild generalized MG? 2. **Thymic Imaging:** Given the absence of chest symptoms but the known association between MG and thymic abnormalities, would you recommend proceeding directly to a chest CT with contrast, or is MRI preferred in your practice? Are there specific features on imaging that would prompt earlier surgical referral, even in the absence of symptoms? 3. **Initial Symptomatic Management:** While awaiting"

Outcomes are typically better in hyperplasia (lower malignancy risk, good response to surgery) than thymoma, but both groups may benefit from thymectomy. 2. For initial immunosuppression, I usually start with prednisone, adding a steroid-sparing agent (e.g., azathioprine or mycophenolate) if long-term therapy is anticipated or if there are contraindications to steroids; prominent bulbar symptoms warrant close monitoring, but absence of respiratory involvement allows for oral therapy with careful titration."

Reason: A Gastroenterologist is the most appropriate specialist because the baby's primary symptoms\u2014feeding difficulties, abdominal distension (swelling), localized abdominal tenderness (especially on the right side), fussiness with abdominal palpation, and pale stools\u2014strongly suggest a problem involving the gastrointestinal (GI) tract or associated organs (such as the liver or biliary system).

A few points and questions to further refine our differential and management: **1. Choledochal cyst vs. Biliary atresia:** - The acute onset and localized right-sided swelling make a choledochal cyst with possible complication (e.g., cyst rupture, infection, or obstruction) a strong consideration. - Biliary atresia typically presents with progressive jaundice and pale stools over weeks, but could an atypical presentation occur at this age? - Would you expect more pronounced jaundice or failure to thrive if this were biliary atresia? **2.

For renal/perinephric abscess, percutaneous drainage is generally recommended for abscesses >3 cm or if there is poor clinical response to antibiotics alone; small (<3 cm), well-localized abscesses in stable patients may be managed with IV antibiotics and close monitoring. 2. Empirically, I suggest IV ceftriaxone plus metronidazole or IV piperacillin-tazobactam, adjusting for allergies and local resistance; consider broader coverage (e.g., carbapenem) if prior antibiotics or risk factors for resistant organisms. 3. If imaging is negative, I would prioritize blood cultures and, if positive or if clinical suspicion remains, proceed with echocardiography to evaluate for endocarditis or other occult sources."

However, the lack of prodrome and the clear situational trigger (post-micturition, standing up) also fits with a vasovagal reflex.

Based on what you\u2019ve shared, I am concerned about a possible postpartum infection, such as endometritis, especially given your fever, chills, lower abdominal pain, and history of prolonged labor. Your increased urinary frequency could also suggest a urinary tract infection, though you don\u2019t have pain with urination. To help guide your care, I have a few more questions: 1. Have you noticed any new or worsening vaginal bleeding since your symptoms began? 2. Are you experiencing any nausea or vomiting? 3. Is your abdominal tenderness getting worse, staying the same, or improving? 4. Have you noticed any foul odor or pus from any tears, stitches, or wounds in your perineal area? 5. Are you able to keep fluids down and stay hydrated? 6. Has your baby shown any signs of illness, such as fever, poor feeding, or lethargy? Your answers will help me determine the urgency and next steps for your care."

A few points for further discussion and clarification: 1. **Aura Characterization:** The muddy taste as an aura is interesting. Would you consider this a classic gustatory aura, and does this further localize the seizure focus within the temporal lobe (e.g., insular or mesial temporal structures)? Are there any additional questions you would suggest to further characterize the aura or localize the focus? 2. **Differential Diagnosis:** While the features are highly suggestive of focal seizures, are there any other conditions you would consider in the differential (e.g., complex migraines, dissociative (non-epileptic) events, metabolic disturbances), or do you feel these are unlikely given the history? 3."

The physical findings and mechanism strongly suggest a flexor tendon injury, specifically a flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) tendon avulsion, commonly known as \"jersey finger.\" The X-ray rules out fracture or dislocation, further supporting a soft tissue (tendon) injury. Orthopedic Surgeons, particularly those with hand surgery expertise, are the specialists trained to diagnose and surgically repair tendon injuries of the hand. Prompt evaluation and management are crucial to restore finger function and prevent permanent disability.

On fundus exam, CMV retinitis typically shows granular, yellow-white retinal necrosis with perivascular hemorrhages (\"pizza pie\" or \"cheese and ketchup\" appearance), often starting in the posterior pole or along retinal vessels, with minimal vitritis; toxoplasmosis usually has a focal, fluffy white lesion with intense vitritis (\"headlight in the fog\"), HSV/VZV can show peripheral necrosis with more inflammation, and syphilitic retinitis is often multifocal with associated vasculitis. 2. Given the high suspicion and risk of vision loss, I recommend starting empiric systemic therapy (oral valganciclovir if possible, or IV ganciclovir if severe or unable to take oral), and consider intravitreal ganciclovir/foscarnet if there is sight-threatening involvement (e.g., macula or optic nerve).

To summarize, we have a patient with four months of chronic, non-bloody, mucous-containing diarrhea (3\u20135 loose stools/day), lower abdominal cramping relieved by defecation, and some bloating. There are no constitutional symptoms (no weight loss, fever, night sweats, or fatigue), no family history of GI disease, and no prior similar episodes. The onset followed a camping trip with exposure to untreated stream water, but stool studies (ova/parasites and culture) are negative. Given these findings, here are my thoughts and questions for further refinement: **1. Infectious Etiology:** - Giardia and other common parasites have been ruled out by stool studies. Chronic bacterial infections are also unlikely given negative cultures and lack of systemic symptoms. - Is there value in repeating stool studies or sending for less common pathogens (e.g., Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora, or PCR-based panels), or do you feel this"

Would you also recommend testing for Clostridioides difficile, even in the absence of recent antibiotic use, or is that low yield here? - If the PCR panel is negative, would you consider empiric anti-parasitic therapy (e.g., nitazoxanide) or do you feel that is unnecessary without laboratory confirmation? 2. **IBS-D Considerations:** - The patient\u2019s symptoms\u2014ch"
