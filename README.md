## Install

1. This library has few dependencies, so you can simply install the requirements.txt!
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Evaluation

All of the models from the paper are available (GPT-4/3.5, Mixtral-8x7B, Llama-70B-chat). You can try them for any of the agents, make sure you have either an OpenAI or Replicate key ready for evaluation! We will be adding huggingface wrappers in the next few days.
